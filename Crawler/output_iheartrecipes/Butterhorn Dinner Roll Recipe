<ingredients>
1 cup warm water about 100 F
4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup +1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups hot water
1/2 cup butter
5 1/2-7 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter melted
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, stir together warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5-10 minutes.
In a separate medium bowl, add butter and remaining sugar. Pour hot water over butter and sugar, and stir to melt.
Let butter mixture cool to about 100 F.
Pour butter mixture into yeast mixture, and stir to combine.
Add 3 cups flour and salt, and stir to combine.
Continue to add flour until dough clings to the dough hook and clears the sides. Dough should be soft and just slightly sticky but shouldn't come off on your finger if you touch it. 
Cover dough with a dry dishcloth, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down, recover, and let rest for 10 minutes.
Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.
Place one piece of dough on a lightly floured surface, and roll into a circle. Dough should be 1/4-inch thick. 
Brush dough with 1 tablespoon melted butter, and cut into 8 wedges. 
Roll up each wedge, starting at the wide end.
Place each roll on greased half sheet pan, tucking point underneath roll.
Repeat with remaining two pieces of dough. Cover rolls and remaining piece of dough as you work.
Cover with dry dish towel, and let rise until double, about 30-45 minutes.
Toward the end of the rising time, preheat oven to 350 F.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until rolls are lightly browned. 
Brush with additional butter, if desired.
