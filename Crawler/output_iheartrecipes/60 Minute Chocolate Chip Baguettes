</details>
<ingredients>
2 &#189; cups warm water about 105 F
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons olive oil
5 &#189;-6 &#189; cups all-purpose flour
12 oz package chocolate chips I use dark semisweet
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large bowl, stir together water, yeast, and sugar.
Let stand 5-10 minutes, or until foamy
Stir in salt, oil, and 2 cups flour.
Continue stirring in enough flour to form a soft, sticky dough (It takes me around 6-6 &#188; cups).
Cover bowl with greased plastic wrap, and let it sit in a warm place for 15 minutes.
Knead in chocolate chips. It&#8217;s ok if they aren't perfectly incorporated at this point.
With lightly floured hands, divide dough into 8 pieces.
Place dough on a lightly floured surface.
Form a piece into a rectangle (about 4x2 inches).
Fold top 3rd of dough back to middle.
Fold bottom 3rd of dough back to middle.
Continue until dough is about 8 inches in length.
Dust dough with additional flour if desired (this just gives it a more rustic look).
Repeat process with remaining dough.
Place dough onto parchment-lined or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheets.
Slash the tops diagonally with a thin, sharp knife.
Cover with greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to sit while you preheat your oven to 350 F.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
