<ingredients>
14 oz. can black beans or pinto beans drained and rinsed
2-10 oz. cans Rotel drained (I use one mild green chile and one cilantro and lime)
1/4 tsp. salt
2 c. shredded Colby Jack cheese blend
2 slices thick cut bacon cooked and crumbled
5 large eggs
1/2 c. low-fat milk
1/2 T. Chipotle Tabasco sauce
8 corn tortillas
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large bowl, stir together black beans, Rotel, and salt.
Spread heaping 1/4 cup of bean mixture on the bottom of a greased 9x9-inch baking dish.
Place 4 tortillas over the bean mixture, overlapping tortillas slightly.
Layer half of bean mixture and then 1 cup of shredded cheese over tortillas.
Add another layer with remaining 4 tortillas.
Top with remaining bean mixture.
Sprinkle crumbled bacon over bean mixture.
In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and Tabasco sauce.
Pour egg mixture over everything.
Cover, and chill for at least 3 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Spray one side of a sheet of aluminum foil with nonstick cooking spray, and cover baking pan tightly with foil.
Bake for 30-40 minutes.
Top with remaining 1 cup cheese.
Return to oven, and bake, uncovered, for another 5-10 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Let stand 5-10 minutes, uncovered, before serving.
