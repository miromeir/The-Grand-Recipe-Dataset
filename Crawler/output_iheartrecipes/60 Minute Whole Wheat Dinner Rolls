<ingredients>
1/4 c . low-fat milk
2 T . granulated sugar
1/3 c . butter divided
3 &#189; tsp . dry active yeast
3/4 c . warm water (105F &#8211; 115F)
1 &#188; - 2 c all-purpose flour
1 c . whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp . salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Grease a 12-cup muffin tin; set aside.
In a small saucepan, stir milk, sugar, and 3 tablespoons butter together.
Heat over low heat just until butter melts and sugar dissolves.
Cool to about 100-105 F.
Pour the milk mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the yeast and warm water. Let stand for 5-10 minutes, or until yeast is foamy.
Add 1 cup each all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour and salt to yeast mixture.
Using a dough hook, mix on low speed for about 1 minute.
With the mixer still going, add remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time.
Mix about 1 &#189; minutes, or until dough starts to clean the sides of the bowl.
Knead on low speed for about 2 more minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic &#8211; the dough will still be slightly sticky to the touch.
Place dough in a greased bowl, turning it to grease the top. Cover the dough with a clean, dry dish towel.
Let it rise in a warm place, free from draft, for about 15 minutes.
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 12 equal pieces.
Form each piece into a ball, and cut each ball into thirds.
Place 3 dough balls in each muffin cup.
Cover the muffin pan with the dish towel, and let the dough rise for about 15 minutes.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Set aside
Bake at 425&#186;F for 9-12 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown.
Brush rolls with melted butter.
Remove from pans, and cool on wire racks.
