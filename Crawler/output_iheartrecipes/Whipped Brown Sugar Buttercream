<ingredients>
7 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups milk
1 1/2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups salted butter at cool room temperature*
1 1/2 cups brown sugar packed
Pinch of salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will be the consistency of a thick pancake batter.
Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
Stir in vanilla.
While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter, sugar, and salt together until light and fluffy on medium high, about 3 minutes.
Then add the completely cooled milk mixture.
Beat it for about 5 minutes on medium-high to high until it looks like whipped cream. If you can still taste the sugar granules, keep beating it until you can&#8217;t.
