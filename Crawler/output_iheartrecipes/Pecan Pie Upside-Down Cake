<ingredients>
CAKE
1/2 c . butter softened
3/4 c . granulated sugar
3 large eggs
2/3 c . buttermilk
1 tsp . vanilla extract
1 1/2 c . cake flour
1 tsp . baking powder
1/2 tsp . salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugar until well-combined.
Scrape down sides, and add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Mix in buttermilk and vanilla.
Add flour, baking powder, and salt.
Stir until just combined. Set aside.
To make the topping, stir together butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and whipping cream until well-combined.
Pour into pan.
Top with pecans.
Gently spoon batter over pecans. If you pour it in, it may push the pecans in the middle aside, so gently add the batter on top of the pecans.
Place pan on rimmed baking sheet.
Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out without any cake crumbs.
Run a knife around the edge, and then invert cake onto plate.
