<ingredients>
1 lb . thick-cut bacon
1 T. butter
1 white onion diced
1 green pepper chopped
1 red pepper chopped
30 oz . package frozen hash browns thawed
1 tsp . salt
1 tsp . pepper
12 large eggs
1 1/2 c . milk
1 T. chipotle hot sauce
2 c . shredded cheddar cheese
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 Line a large rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper.
Lay bacon on lined pan so that it's close but isn't touching.
Bake for about 10 minutes or until tender-crisp. You don't want it to be crisp because it's going to bake longer when the casserole cooks.
Let bacon cool on baking sheet.
Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any extra grease.
To make the casserole, heat butter in a large skillet.
Add diced onion and peppers.
Cook until onion is translucent and peppers have softened.
Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking dish.
Layer hashbrowns and cooked veggies.
Season with salt and pepper.
Crumble cooked bacon over the top of the veggies.
Top with 1 cup cheese.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and hot sauce.
Pour over hash brown mixture.
Top with remaining cup of cheddar cheese.
Cover pan with aluminum foil, and place in the fridge overnight.
In the morning, get casserole out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to bake it.
Preheat oven to 400 F.
Bake casserole, covered, for about 45 minutes.
Uncover, and continue cooking for about 15 minutes longer, or until casserole is set and has baked through.
I like to serve this with additional chipotle hot sauce or salsa.
