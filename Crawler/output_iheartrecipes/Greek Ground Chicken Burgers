CHICKEN BURGER
1 pound fresh ground chicken
1/3 cup plain breadcrumbs
1/4 cup Feta cheese crumbled
1/4 cup Kalamata olives pitted and chopped
2 tablespoons parsley minced, plus extra for garnishing
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3 cloves garlic minced
1 large egg lightly beaten
Salt and pepper to taste
Cucumber slices,tomato slices, red onion slices, or any other desired toppings
4 pieces pita bread*
</ingredients>
<instructions>
To make the chicken burgers, preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet.
Add the ground chicken, bread crumbs, Feta, olives, parsley, lemon juice, oregano, garlic, egg and salt and pepper to a large bowl.
Mix until the ingredients are all incorporated. I use my hands. I think it's easier and does a better job of mixing everything together.
Divide the mixture into four equal portions.
Shape each portion into a patty, making a slight indention in the middle.
Lightly spray grill or pan with a nonstick cooking spray.
Cook the burgers until they reach your desired level of doneness. The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 165 F. I used a grill pan, and it took about 10-15 minutes to cook them through.
While the burgers are cooking, prepare the tzatziki.
In a medium bowl, stir together cucumber, yogurt, lemon juice, parsley, salt, and garlic. If your cucumbers are watery, squeeze or drain the liquid from the cucumber first.
Once the burgers are done, place each one on a piece of pita bread.
Top burger with sliced cucumber, tomato, or any other desired toppings.
Drizzle some tzatziki over the veggies, and then sprinkle with a little extra parsley.
