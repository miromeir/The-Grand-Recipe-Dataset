<ingredients>
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 &#189; cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 &#189; cups salted butter at cool room temperature
1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder I use Dutch-processed
Pinch of salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small saucepan, whisk flour and milk together until well-combined.
Heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens.
Remove from heat, and let it cool to room temperature.*
Stir in vanilla.
While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt together until light and fluffy on medium high, about 5 minutes.
Add the completely cooled milk mixture.
Beat it for about 5 minutes on high until it looks like whipped cream. It may look separated at first, so keep beating it until it comes together and looks like a whipped cream.
If it looks separated after about 7 minutes of whipping, cover, and chill for about 30 minutes. Then, continue whipping for about 5 minutes, or until it looks like whipped cream.
