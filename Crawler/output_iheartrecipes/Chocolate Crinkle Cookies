Let dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Place granulated sugar and powdered sugar in separate shallow dishes. 
Working with 1.5 tablespoons dough (a medium cookie scoop) at a time, drop scoop of dough into granulated sugar. 
Roll in granulated sugar, and then roll in powdered sugar. 
Place dough about 2 inches apart on prepared baking pan. 
Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until puffed and cracked and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft. The cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone, about 9-12 minutes.&#179;
