<ingredients>
BREAD PUDDING
16 ounce loaf day-old cinnamon swirl bread
3 cups milk half-and-half, or a combination of the two
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
For the bread pudding, preheat oven to 325 F.
Cut bread into cubes, and add to a baking dish. I used a 9x13-inch dish.
In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.
Pour over bread cubes.
Let the bread stand for about 20 minutes to absorb some of the liquid.
Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until done. If it starts to get too brown, tent with foil.
To make the sauce, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apples, and saute for 5 minutes.
Remove apples to a plate, and set aside.
Add the brown sugar and remaining butter to the now empty skillet.
Melt butter over medium heat, stirring regularly.
Once butter has melted and sugar has dissolved, stir in the cream.
Let sauce bubble and thicken for about a minute.
Turn the heat to low, and add the apples back to the skillet.
Stir in cinnamon, and let cook to thicken for another 1-2 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract. 
Serve bread pudding warm topped with sauce.
