COOKIES
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup shortening
1/4 cup butter at cool room temperature
1/4 cup molasses
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 325F.
In large bowl, beat brown sugar, shortening, butter, molasses, and egg until well-combined.
Stir in remaining cookie ingredients.
Scoop dough into 1 1/2-inch balls.
Place dough about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 10-15 minutes, or just until set. The cookies will still look a little wet in the cracks, but the tops and edges should be set.
Let cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes.
Remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack.
Stir together powdered sugar and enough milk to make desired consistency.
Drizzle or dip tops of cookies in icing.
Let set before eating.
