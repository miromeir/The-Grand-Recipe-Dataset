<ingredients>
1 &#188; cups eight-grain hot cereal mix
2 &#189; cups boiling water
2 &#189; cups all-purpose flour
1 &#189; cups whole wheat flour
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup butter melted
2 &#189; teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats or quick oats
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Place cereal mix in bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook, and pour boiling water over it; let stand, stirring occasionally, until mixture cools to 100-105 degrees (F), about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, whisk flours and salt together in separate bowl; set aside.
Once grain mixture has reached 100-105 F, add honey, butter, and yeast and mix stir until combined.
Let mixture sit for 5-10 minutes.
Add flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, and knead until dough starts to come together.
Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let dough rest for 20 minutes.
Knead on medium-low speed until dough clears sides of bowl, 3-4 minutes. If it does not clear sides, keep adding 2 tablespoons additional all-purpose flour and knead until it does.
Once it comes together, continue to knead dough for 5 additional minutes.
Add seeds, and knead until seeds are evenly dispersed throughout the dough and dough forms smooth, round ball.
Place dough in large, lightly greased bowl; cover tightly with plastic, and let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 45-60 minutes.
Grease two 9&#215;5 inch loaf pans.
Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and divide in half.
Stretch first piece of dough into 9&#215;6 inch rectangle.
Roll dough into a cylinder, and place dough seam-side down in prepared loaf pan.
Repeat with second piece of dough.
Spray loaves lightly with water or vegetable oil spray.
Sprinkle both loaves in oats.
Cover loaves loosely with greased plastic, and let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in size 30-40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Bake until loaves register 200 degrees, 30-40 minutes.
Transfer pans to wire rack, and let loaves cool in pan for 5 minutes.
Remove loaves from pans, and let them cool to room temperature on wire cooling rack.
