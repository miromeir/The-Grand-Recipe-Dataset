The night before, heavily butter or grease a 9Ã—9-inch pan on the bottom and sides.
Stand up bread slices in pan.
In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla until well combined.
Pour the mixture evenly over all the bread slices in the pan.

Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, preheat the oven to 350 F.
Remove the French toast casserole from the refrigerator, and set it on a rimmed baking sheet.
In a heavy saucepan over low heat, melt the butter.
Add the brown sugar and corn syrup, and whisk well to combine.
Keep heating over low heat until the sugar is melted and the mixture is bubbly and hot.
Remove from heat.
Gently whisk in the vanilla extract, salt, and pecans.
Carefully and evenly pour the sugar mixture over the French toast casserole, covering each slice well.
Place the casserole on the baking sheet, and bake until golden and baked through, about 35-45 minutes.
