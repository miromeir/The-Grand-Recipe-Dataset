MUFFINS
1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
1/2 T. pumpkin pie spice
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
3/4 c. granulated sugar
1 c. pumpkin puree
2 large eggs
1/4 c. vegetable oil
1/4 c. plain, nonfat Greek yogurt
1/4 c. apple cider or water
1/2 c. fresh cranberries
1 c. diced apple peeled and cored
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, pumpkin, eggs, oil, Greek yogurt, and apple cider in large mixer bowl until well-combined.
Add flour mixture, and stir until just combined.
Gently stir in cranberries and diced apple.
Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins.
For the topping, stir together oats, brown sugar, and pecans.
Cut in butter (or smoosh it in), and form crumbly clumps, and sprinkle over muffins.
Muffins will be full, so if you're worried about the crumble falling off into your oven, throw the tin on a sheet pan.
Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool in pan for 10 minutes, and then remove to wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
