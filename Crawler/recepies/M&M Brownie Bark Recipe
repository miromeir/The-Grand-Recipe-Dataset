<ingredients>
1/4 cup (60 g) all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons (15 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Pinch or two of salt
2 large egg whites
1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar

1/4 cup (50 g) vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup (120 g) M&M candies (or more to taste)
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line a jelly roll pan with a piece of parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.
Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In a separate medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg whites.
Add the sugars, oil, and vanilla, whisking until smooth and well-combined.
Whisk in the flour mixture until just incorporated.
Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Youâ€™ll want it to be spread as thin as possible.
Sprinkle M&M's over the batter.
Bake for 20 minutes.
Let the bark cool in the pan until it reaches room temperature.
When the bark is at room temperature, break it into pieces.
Store at room temperature in an airtight container.
