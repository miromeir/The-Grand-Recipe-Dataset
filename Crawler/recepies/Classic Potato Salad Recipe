Bring potatoes to a boil in large pot of cold salted water.

Peel the skins from the potatoes and cut into large dice.
Add the potatoes to a large mixing bowl, and drizzle with vinegar. Stir to coat.
Let the potatoes to cool to room temperature.
Add celery, green onions, and chopped eggs. Toss to combine. 
In a separate bowl, stir together mayonnaise, relish, mustard, celery seed, salt, and pepper.
Add the mayonnaise mixture to the potato mixture, and stir to combine. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.
Sprinkle with paprika if desired.
Chill until ready to serve. The potato salad tastes better if it has a chance to sit for a while.
