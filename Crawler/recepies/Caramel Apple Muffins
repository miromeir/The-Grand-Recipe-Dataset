<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners and lightly grease with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together water, butter, vinegar, vanilla, and egg until well-combined.
Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined.
Fold in apple and caramel bits until just incorporated.
Scoop batter into prepared tins.
Sprinkle muffins with chopped pecans, if using.
Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffin comes out clean (it may have a little caramel on it, but it shouldnâ€™t have crumbs on it).
Cool in tin for 5 minutes, and then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
Serve muffins warm or at room temperature.
