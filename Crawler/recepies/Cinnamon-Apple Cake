Preheat oven to 350 F.
Beat 1 cup granulated sugar, butter, yogurt, vanilla, and cream cheese at medium speed of a mixer until well-blended (about 4 minutes).
Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt.
Add flour mixture to creamed mixture, beating at low speed until blended.
Combine remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and cinnamon.
Combine 2 tablespoons cinnamon/sugar mixture and chopped apple in a bowl.
Stir apple mixture into batter.
Pour batter into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan coated with cooking spray, and sprinkle with remaining cinnamon/sugar mixture.
Bake for 35-45 minutes or until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan.
Cool the cake completely on a wire rack, and cut using a serrated knife.
Note: You can also make this cake in a 9-inch square cake pan or a 9-inch springform pan; just reduce the cooking time by 5-10 minutes.
