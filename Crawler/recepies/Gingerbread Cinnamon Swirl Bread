<instructions>
Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, dry yeast, and salt in a large mixer bowl and stir until blended.
Combine water, milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl.
Microwave on HIGH in 15 second increments until very warm but not hot to the touch (about 120°F. Butter won’t melt completely).
Add milk mixture and molasses to flour mixture.
Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 1 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed, scraping bowl occasionally.
Stir in just enough remaining flour so that the dough will form into a ball.
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic and springs back when lightly pressed with 2 fingers, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Cover with a towel; let rest for 10 minutes.
Cut dough into 2 equal pieces.
Roll piece of dough into a 12 x 7-inch rectangle using a rolling pin.
Mix together cinnamon and sugar for the filling.
Brush 2 T. oil onto surface of dough.
Sprinkle with half cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Beginning at short end of each rectangle, roll up tightly.
Pinch seams and ends to seal.
Place, seam sides down, in greased 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inch loaf pan.
Repeat with remaining piece dough.
Cover with towel; let rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Bake in preheated 400ºF oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans by running a knife around the edges and invert onto wire rack.
