<ingredients>
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon olive oil , divided
1 pound pizza dough
3 cloves garlic , minced
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 cup ricotta , part-skim or whole milk ok
1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese , divided
3/4 cup pizza sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella
1/4 cup mini pepperoni
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 F.
Grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet with 1 teaspoon olive oil. 
In a small bowl, stir together remaining tablespoon olive oil, garlic, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. Set aside.
Divide pizza dough into 30 pieces. Each piece will be small. 
Shape each piece into a ball, and lightly coat with olive oil mixture.
Place 18 dough balls around the outside edge of the prepared skillet.
Top with remaining 12 dough balls, staggering dough at the seams.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until dough is just beginning to lightly brown.
While dough is baking, stir ricotta and 2 tablespoons parmesan together in a small bowl.
Spread ricotta mixture in the opening in the middle of the skillet.
Top with pizza sauce and then pepperoni.
Sprinkle mozzarella and remaining 2 tablespoons parmesan over the top. It's ok if some of the cheese ends up on the garlic bread pieces.
Return to the oven, and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
Let cool 10 minutes. Serve warm from the skillet.
