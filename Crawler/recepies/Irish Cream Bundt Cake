<ingredients>
CAKE
15.25 ounce package yellow cake mix
4 ounce package instant vanilla pudding mix
4 large eggs
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons Greek yogurt
3/4 cup Irish Cream coffee creamer I used Bailey's
1 cup chopped pecans optional
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 325F. Grease and flour a 10-inch bundt pan.
In a large bowl, combine cake and pudding mix.
Add eggs, water, oil, yogurt, and creamer. Beat on low for 30 seconds until just barely combined. Turn mixer up to high and beat for 4 more minutes at high speed.
 If using nuts, sprinkle nuts in an even layer in the bottom of the bundt pan.
Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan.
Prepare glaze while cake is cooling in pan. Combine butter, water, and sugar in small saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat and stir in creamer.
Invert cake onto a wire rack. Place a plate under the wire rack to catch the glaze as it drips off.
Prick top and sides of cake.
Spoon glaze over top and brush onto sides of cake.
Let cake absorb glaze; repeat until all glaze is used.
