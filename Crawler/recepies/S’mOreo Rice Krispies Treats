<ingredients>
About 5 sheets graham crackers
5 T . butter
10 oz package miniature marshmallows
5 c . Rice Krispies cereal
12 Oreo Cookies coarsely chopped
1 ½ c Marshmallow crème
1 c . chocolate chips
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Line a 9x9-inch pan with graham crackers, breaking to fit; set aside.
Melt the butter in a large pot over low heat.
Add the marshmallows, and stir until melted.
Remove from heat, and stir in the Rice Krispies and the chopped Oreo cookies.
Drop the marshmallow/cereal mixture into prepared pan, and gently press cereal down.
Spread a thin layer of marshmallow crème over cereal mixture.
Broil, if desired, until lightly toasted. Watch it carefully, though, because it only takes about 20 seconds to toast.
Remove from oven, if toasting, and sprinkle with chocolate chips
Let the squares sit at room temperature until firm, about 1 hour.
Cut into squares, and enjoy.
