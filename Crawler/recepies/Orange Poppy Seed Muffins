<ingredients>
MUFFINS
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons orange zest
1/2 cup fresh orange juice about 2 large oranges
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/2 cup plain non-fat Greek yogurt
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil*
1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Place the sugar in a medium mixing bowl along with the orange zest. Mix the two together until combined. 
Stir in the flour, poppy seeds, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, Greek yogurt, milk, oil, vanilla extract, almond extract, and orange juice.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir together until just combined. Do not overmix.
Divide the batter among the 12 muffin cups, filling three-quarters of the way to the top. 
Bake 12-14 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
For the glaze, melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. You'll want the butter to be just melted but not hot.
Whisk in the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon orange juice. Continue adding juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, until your desired consistency is reached.
Drizzle over the top of the muffins.
