<ingredients>
1/2 c . butter
2 c . milk
4 large eggs , separated
1/8 tsp . vinegar
1 ½ c . powdered sugar , extra powdered sugar for dusting
1 T . water
2 tsp . red food color (or red velvet cake bakery emulsion)
1 tsp . vanilla extract
1 c . all-purpose flour
2 T . unsweetened cocoa powder
Pinch of salt (about 1/8 tsp.)
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper; grease or butter the parchment paper.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter.
Add the milk to the butter, and heat until mixture reaches about 80-85 F.
Remove milk mixture from heat, and set aside.
With an electric mixer (either stand or hand), whip the egg whites and vinegar together until it reaches the stiff peak stage. Set aside.
While the egg whites are beating, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well-combined.
Whisk in the milk mixture, water, red color, and vanilla until well-combined.
Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt, and whisk together until evenly incorporated.
Gently fold in the egg whites in two additions.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. It may look curdled, and that’s ok.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the top looks done.
Allow cake to completely cool to about room temperature, and then chill until ready to serve. Do not cut before it reaches room temperature, though.
Generously dust with powdered sugar before serving.
