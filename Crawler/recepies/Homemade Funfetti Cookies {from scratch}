<ingredients>
1/2 cup (113 g) butter
1/2 cup (99 g) granulated sugar
1/4 cup (54 g) brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
1 3/4 cups (210 g) all-purpose flour*
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup sprinkles**
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.
In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.
Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.
Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.
Gently fold in sprinkles
Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place on baking sheet.
Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.***
