<ingredients>
2 large egg yolks
2 large eggs
1/4 c . all-purpose flour
1 c . Nutella plus extra for drizzling
1/2 tsp . vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 425 F. Grease and flour 4 ramekins, and set them to a rimmed cookie sheet.
Using a mixer (either hand or stand), beat yolks and eggs until pale yellow, about 3 minutes.
Add flour, and beat until well-combined.
Stir in Nutella and vanilla.
Divide batter evenly among ramekins.
At this point, the ramekins can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.
Bake cakes until edges are set but the centers is still jiggly, about 12â€“14 minutes. If you overbake the cakes, then they won't have much molten Nutella in the middle.
Transfer cookie sheet to a wire cooling rack.
Let cakes cool for 5 minutes.
Run a thin knife around edges of ramekins to loosen cakes, and invert cakes onto plates.
Top with sliced bananas or strawberries, ice cream, or more Nutella (if desired).
Serve warm.
