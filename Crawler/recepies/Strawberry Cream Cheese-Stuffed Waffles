WAFFLES
2 ¼ c . lukewarm milk about 80 F
2 ¼ tsp . active dry yeast
1/4 c . granulated sugar
6 T . vegetable oil
3 large eggs
1 tsp . vanilla extract
3 c . all-purpose flour

<instructions>
In a large bowl, stir together milk, yeast, and sugar. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until foamy.
Stir in remaining ingredients until combined.
Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 10-15 minutes; the mixture will begin to bubble.
Preheat your waffle iron.
Spray iron with non-stick cooking spray, and pour 2/3 to 3/4 cup batter (or the amount recommended by the manufacturer) onto the center of the iron.
Close the lid, and bake for the recommended amount of time, or until the waffle is golden brown.
Meanwhile, beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until well-combined.
To serve, spread waffle with cream cheese mixture and pie filling. Top with second waffle. You may want to warm the pie filling.
Top second waffle with more pie filling.
