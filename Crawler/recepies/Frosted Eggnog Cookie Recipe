Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon until combined. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugars until well-combined.
Beat in egg yolks one at a time, scraping down the sides as necessary.
Mix in vanilla extract, brandy flavor, and egg nog until combined. Batter may look curdled at this point.
Add dry ingredients, and mix until just combined.
Scoop dough using a medium cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoons), and drop onto prepared baking sheets, spacing cookies 2-inches apart.
Bake for 10-13 minutes.
Let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
To make the frosting, beat together butter, powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons eggnog, brandy flavor, and salt.
Beat until well-combined, adding in additional eggnog as needed.
Frost cooled cookies with eggnog frosting, and sprinkle with additional nutmeg, if desired.
