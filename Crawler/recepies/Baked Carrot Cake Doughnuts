<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Coat a 6-cup doughnut tin with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together flours, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
Add egg, brown sugar, oil, milk, and vanilla to the well. Stir ingredients together until just combined.
Stir in carrot and nuts, if using.
Scoop the batter into the prepared cups.
Bake until a toothpick comes out without crumbs, 8-10 minutes.
Let cool in pan for at 10 minutes.
Once you remove the doughnuts, keep the oven on.
Place coconut on a small rimmed cookie sheet, and bake for 7-8 minutes, stirring twice (to avoid burnt edges).
To make the glaze, beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and milk.
Drizzle glaze over cooled doughnuts, and top with toasted coconut.
