<ingredients>
2 1/4 cups rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon apple pie spice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter melted
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
3/4 cup brown sugar packed - light or dark ok
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup finely diced apple
1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
Sparkling white sugar optional
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir oats, flour, baking soda, salt, apple pie spice, and cinnamon together. Set aside.
In a separate large bowl, whisk butter, applesauce, and sugars together until combined. 
Whisk in the egg and vanilla until well-combined. 
Stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. 
Fold in the apples and nuts. The cookie dough will feel thick and maybe even a little dry. 
Using a medium cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoon), scoop cookie dough, and place 2 inches apart on the cookie sheet. 
Sprinkle with sparkling sugar, if using.
Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until set and lightly browned at the edges.
Let cool 5-10 minutes on baking sheet, and then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
