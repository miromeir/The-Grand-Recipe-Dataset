In a small heavy saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Continue cooking until butter is golden amber brown and has a nutty fragrance. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat yogurt and sugar together until well-combined.
Beat in butter.
Add eggs one at a time, and mix well to combined.
Stir in vanilla
Add flour mixture, and stir in until just combined.
Toss in fresh cranberries.
Pour batter into prepared bundt pan.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. You may need to cover the exposed cake with foil if it starts to brown too much.
Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
