350 F. Grease 2 6-count donut pans; set aside.
In a small bowl, stir together yeast and water. Let it sit for 5 minutes, or until foamy.
Meanwhile, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, whisk eggs.
Stir in butter and Greek yogurt.
Add milk and vanilla, and stir until well-combined.
Whisk in yeast mixture and flour mixture until just combined.
Divide batter evenly among prepared donut pans.
Bake 10-15 minutes, or until donuts spring back when lightly touched.
Remove from oven, and let donuts sit for 5 minutes before removing to a wire cooling rack.
While donuts are cooling, whisk together powdered sugar, enough milk for desired consistency, and vanilla extract.
Dip tops of warm donuts in glaze, and then place on cooling rack until glaze sets up.
Enjoy!
