<ingredients>
CHOCOLATE CAKE
1/2 c . butter
1/4 c . cocoa
1 c . water
1/2 c . low-fat buttermilk
1/4 c . fat-free plain Greek yogurt
2 eggs
1 tsp . vanilla extract
2 c . all-purpose flour
1 1/4 c . granulated sugar
1 tsp . baking soda
1/2 tsp . salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a cookie sheet (I use a 15x11-inch rimmed cookie sheet) with edges.
Melt butter in a large saucepan.
Once butter has melted, stir in water and cocoa powder; bring to a boil.
Once at a boil, add buttermilk, and stir to combine.
Remove pan from heat.
Add the yogurt, eggs, and vanilla, and stir until well-combined.
Stir in sugar, flour, baking soda, and salt until just combined.
Bake for 15-20 minutes.
While the cake is baking prepare the icing.
For the icing, combine the butter, cocoa, and buttermilk. Bring to a boil.
Remove from heat, and add the powdered sugar, vanilla, and nuts (if using). Stir to combine. Pour icing over hot cake and spread evenly over cake.
