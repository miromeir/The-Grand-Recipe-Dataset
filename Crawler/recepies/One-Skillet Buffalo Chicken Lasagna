<ingredients>
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 Â½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breast, in bite-sized pieces
1 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup finely chopped carrot
2 cloves garlic minced
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2-14.5 ounce cans diced tomatoes undrained

Bleu cheese
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-low heat.
Add chicken, and cook until no longer pink.
Add the onion, celery, and carrot; cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Add the garlic and Italian seasoning, and cook for 30 seconds.
Stir in tomatoes, broth, buffalo wing sauce, liquid smoke, and egg noodles.
Cook, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes, or until noodles are al dente and sauce is reduced down to about 1/3 original starting volume.
Stir in ricotta, and add salt and pepper to taste.
Remove from heat, and top with shredded cheese.
Let the lasagna sit for about 5 minutes for cheese to melt. If I already have the oven on, I just pop the pan in (make sure your skillet is oven safe first, thougto let the cheese melt. It takes about 3-4 minutes.
Top with crumbled bleu cheese just before serving.
