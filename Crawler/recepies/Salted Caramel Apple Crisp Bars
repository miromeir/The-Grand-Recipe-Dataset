Scoop out 1 Â½-cups of the oat mixture and press into prepared pan.
Bake crust for 10 minutes.
While crust is baking, stir together apple slices, flour, sugar, and spices.
Once crust has baked, pour apples over crust.
Drizzle caramel sauce over apples.
Sprinkle remaining crumb mixture over apples.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until crumbs are lightly golden brown and apples are soft.
Drizzle with extra caramel sauce, if desired, and serve warm.
