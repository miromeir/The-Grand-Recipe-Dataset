<ingredients>
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 cup finely diced yellow or white onion
16 ounces dry elbow macaroni pasta
3 cups beef or chicken broth
28 ounce can crushed tomato
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt*
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ancho chile powder
Salt and pepper
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese plus extra for topping
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Heat a Dutch oven or large deep skillet over medium-high heat.
Add beef, and cook until browned. 
Drain ground beef, and return to skillet. 
Stir in onion, and, stirring regularly, cook until just softened, about 3 minutes. 
Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT cheese, and stir to combine.
Bring to simmer, and reduce heat to medium-low. You want the mixture to simmer gently, not boil. 
Cook for about 10 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed but mixture is still saucy. At this point, the pasta should be al dente. 
Stir in cheese. 
Sprinkle with additional cheese, if desired. 
Remove from heat, and serve.
