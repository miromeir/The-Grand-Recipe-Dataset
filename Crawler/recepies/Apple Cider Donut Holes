<instructions>
In a small pan, bring cider to a rapid boil.
Continue to boil on high heat until cider is reduced by half, about 12 minutes. Cool completely.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and apple pie spice.
In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, melted butter, and cooled cider.
Stir cider mixture into dry ingredients until just combined (dough will be sticky).
Cover, and refrigerate for at least, 1 hour or until firm enough to shape.
In a deep, heavy pot, heat oil to 365F.
Carefully drop dough by teaspoonfuls in hot oil a few at time.
Cook donut holes about 1 to 1-1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels.
Cool for about 2 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
While donut holes are cooling, stir together sugar and cinnamon.
Roll donut holes in prepared cinnamon/sugar.
