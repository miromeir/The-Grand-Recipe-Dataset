<ingredients>
CINNAMON SUGAR KNOTS
1/4 cup butter
1 cup milk
2 tablespoon instant yeast*
2 tablespoons honey**
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
3-3 ½ cups all-purpose flour***
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small saucepan, melt butter.
When butter is mostly melted, stir in milk, and heat mixture to 100-110 F.
Meanwhile, add yeast and honey to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl if mixing by hand).
When milk mixture is at temperature, add to yeast and honey; stir to combine.
Add salt and egg, and stir until combined.
Stir in 2 ½ cups of flour.
Add remaining flour until dough clings to paddle and cleans the sides of the bowl.
Switch to the dough hook, and knead for 2 minutes (or by hand for about 5 minutes).
While dough it kneading, stir together granulated sugar and cinnamon in a wide, shallow dish.
Preheat oven to 400 Line a 9x13-inch rimmed cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking liner. Set aside.
Divide dough into 12 pieces.
Roll piece of dough into rope 8 inches long.
Dip in butter, and then roll in cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Tie dough into knots, and place dough on prepared baking sheet. If you'd like a how-to on shaping the knots, check out the video just above the recipe.
Repeat process with remaining dough.
Cover, and let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Bake for about 9-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
While the knots are baking, prepare the icing.
Stir together melted butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla.
Add 1 tablespoon milk, and stir in. Continue adding milk until icing reaches desired consistency. I use about 1 1/2-2 tablespoons for a thicker icing.
Remove knots from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes.
Drizzle icing over knots, and serve warm.
