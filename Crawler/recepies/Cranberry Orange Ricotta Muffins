Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugars, until light and fluffy.
Add the egg, and beat until well-incorporated.
Add the ricotta, milk, orange juice concentrate, and orange zest. Mix gently to combine.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix lightly, just until incorporated.
Fold in the cranberries.
Scoop the batter into the muffin tins.
Sprinkle muffins with raw sugar.
Bake until the muffins are puffed and golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15-24 minutes.
Let cool in pan for about 5 minutes. Then remove from pan and cool on a rack.
