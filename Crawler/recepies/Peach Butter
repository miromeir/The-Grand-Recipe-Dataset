<ingredients>
3 c . chopped peeled peaches
1/4 c . granulated sugar you may need to add more depending on the ripeness of your peaches
2 T . lemon juice
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Puree peaches until smooth.
Add peach puree, sugar, and lemon juice to a large saucepan; stir to combine.
Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until peaches cooked down and have thickened. It took about 40 minutes for my peach puree to thicken.
Let it cool to about room temperature, and then it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for about a week.
