<ingredients>
3-4 pound boneless pork shoulder
1 T . olive oil
1/2 T . ground cumin
1/2 T . dried oregano
1/2 T . fresh ground pepper
1 tsp . kosher salt
4 cloves garlic minced
2 T . fresh-squeezed lime juice about 1 large lime

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Drizzle the olive oil in the slow cooker bowl.
Place untrimmed pork, fat side down in the bowl. Then turn it so the fat side is up. This coats both sides with olive oil.
Sprinkle the roast with salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano.
Spoon the garlic over the roast.
Pour the lime juice and orange juice around the edges of the roast.
Cover, and cook on low for 8-10 hours, or until meat falls apart when shredded with a fork.
I let it continue to cook for about another 30 minutes after I shred it to let it absorb more of the juices.
To assemble the sandwiches, preheat broiler.
Cut sandwich rolls in half.
Place half of sandwich rolls (either tops or bottoms) on a baking sheet.
Place a slice of Swiss cheese on that half of the roll.
Broil for about 2-3 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
Layer ham, slow cooked pork, pickles, and mustard on bun.
Enjoy!
