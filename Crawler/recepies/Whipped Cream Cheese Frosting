<ingredients>
1/2 c . all-purpose flour
1 ½ c . milk
1 ½ T . pure vanilla extract
16 oz . cream cheese , at room temperature (I used full-fat cream cheese and recommend that)
1 c . salted butter , at room temperature
1 ½ c . granulated sugar
Pinch or two of salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will should look like thick pancake batter.
Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
Stir in vanilla.
While the mixture is cooling, cream the cream cheese, butter, sugar, and salt together until light and fluffy on medium high, about 3-5 minutes.
Then add the completely cooled milk mixture.
Beat it for about 3-5 minutes on medium-high to high.
Chill any leftover frosting.
