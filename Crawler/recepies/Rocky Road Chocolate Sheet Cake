<ingredients>
CHOCOLATE CAKE
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup water
1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk
1/4 cup fat-free plain Greek yogurt
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup granulated sugar
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a rimmed cookie sheet (I use a 15x11-inch). Set aside.
Melt butter in a large saucepan.
Once butter has melted, stir in water and cocoa powder; bring to a boil.
Once at a boil, add buttermilk, and stir to combine.
Remove pan from heat.
Add the yogurt, eggs, and vanilla, and stir until well-combined.
Stir in sugar, flour, baking soda, and salt until just combined.
Bake for 15-20 minutes.
While the cake is baking prepare the icing.
For the icing, combine the butter, cocoa, and buttermilk. Bring to a boil.
Remove from heat, and add the powdered sugar, vanilla, and half of marshmallows. Stir to combine.
Sprinkle remaining half marshmallows over hot cake.
Pour icing over hot cake, and spread evenly over cake.
Sprinkle with chopped almonds.
