Preheat oven to 350 F.
Place coconut in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake for 7-8 minutes, or until coconut is toasted. Stir twice while it’s baking.
If necessary, warm caramel until it’s easily spreadable.
In a large bowl, toss caramel and cereal together until cereal is coated well.
Fold in toasted coconut.
Spread chex mix onto a sheet of parchment paper or a baking sheet.
Bake for about 5 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
Remove from oven, and let the Chex mix cool.
Melt chocolate chips (I used a double boiler).
Drizzle melted chocolate over chex mix, and let it cool.
