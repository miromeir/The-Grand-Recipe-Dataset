<ingredients>
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup warm water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg lightly beaten
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips divided
1/2 cup dried tart cherries chopped in large pieces
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together water, oil, vinegar, vanilla, and egg until well-combined.
Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined.
Stir in 1/4 cup mini chips and cherries until just incorporated.
Scoop batter into prepared tins. I used an ice cream scoopful per tin.
Bake for about 12-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffin comes out clean (it may have a little chocolate on it from the chips, but it shouldn’t have crumbs on it).
Cool in tin for 5 minutes, and then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
Serve muffins warm or at room temperature.
