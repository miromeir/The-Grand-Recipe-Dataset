<ingredients>
3 c . rolled oats
2 c . crisp rice cereal (like Rice Krispies)
6 T . granulated sugar
1/4 c . butter
1/4 c . corn syrup
2 T . water
1/4 tsp . salt
1 ½ c . miniature marshmallows , divided
3/4 c . miniature chocolate chips
1/2 c . marshmallow bits
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 425 F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch pan.
Add the oats to the prepared baking pan, and toast for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
While the oats are toasting, add the cereal and half mini marshmallows to a large bowl.
Once the oats have toasted, toss oats and cereal together; set aside.
In a large saucepan, stir together sugar, butter, corn syrup, water, and salt.
Bring to a boil, and continue boiling until mixture reaches 250 F, about 5 minutes.
Pour the syrup over oat mixture, and toss to combine.
Pour the cereal mixture into the pan, and, using a rubber spatula, gently press into the baking pan.
Sprinkle the mini chocolate chips, marshmallow bits, and then remaining mini marshmallows over the cereal mixture in that order.
Bake for 3-4 minutes, or until marshmallows are puffed and golden brown.
Let the bars cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.
Cut into bars or squares while it’s still a little warm. Once the bars cool to room temperature, they will be more difficult to cut.
