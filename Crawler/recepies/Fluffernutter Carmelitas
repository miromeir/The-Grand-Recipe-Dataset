Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan.
In a large saucepan, melt butter and peanut butter together over medium-low heat.
Once butter and peanut butter have melted, remove pan from heat.
Stir in vanilla.
Add flour, oats, sugar, baking soda, and salt, and stir until mixture forms crumbles.
Press half of the crumbles into the greased pan to form a crust.

Remove from oven, and pour half salted caramel sauce over hot crust. Spread gently if necessary. Leave about a half inch border of crust with no caramel sauce around the outside edge.
Sprinkle marshmallows and then chocolate chips over caramel sauce.

Bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
