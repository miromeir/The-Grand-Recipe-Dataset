<ingredients>
3/4 c . solid coconut oil I use extra virgin
1 c . brown sugar
1/3 c . granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 T . vanilla extract
3 c . all-purpose flour
2 T . cornstarch
1 tsp ½ . baking soda
1 tsp . kosher salt
1 c . semisweet chocolate chunks or disks
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or with an electric mixer), beat together the coconut oil and sugars until fluffy and well-combined.
Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla extract until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir in chocolate chunks or disks until just combined.
Drop scoops of dough onto prepared cookie sheets using a medium cookie scoop (1 ½ tablespoons).
Bake for 7-9 minutes. You want the edges to be just barely golden brown.
Remove from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.
