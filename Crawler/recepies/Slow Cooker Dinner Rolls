<ingredients>
1 1/4 cups warm water about 105 F
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
1/4 cup butter melted, plus extra for brushing the tops of the rolls
3-3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Turn slow cooker to "warm". Line with parchment paper and grease parchment with nonstick cooking spray.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook (in a large bowl), stir together water, sugar, and yeast.
Let stand 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.
Stir in butter, and 2 cups flour and salt.
Continue adding flour 1/4 cup at a time until dough clings to the hook and clears the side of the bowl. Dough will feel slightly sticky but shouldn't stick to your finger.
Shape dough into 12-16 rolls, depending on desired size, and add to slow cooker.
Place a thin cotton towel across the top of the slow cooker and cover. Let rolls sit for 10 minutes.
Turn to "high", and cook for about 1 1/2 hours, or until edges are light golden brown. My slow cooker doesn't cook evenly, so I rotate my crock halfway through the cooking time.
If you would like to brown the tops, turn broiler on.
Brush with tops of rolls with melted butter (about 1 tablespoon), and broil for about 1-2 minutes. Watch the rolls closely because they can go from golden to burnt very quickly.
