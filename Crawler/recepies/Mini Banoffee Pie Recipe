</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a slow cooker, cover can of sweetened condensed milk by 2 inches.
Cover, and cook on low 8 hours.
If you would prefer to cook sweetened condensed milk on the stovetop, place in saucepan and cover with water.
Boil for 2 1/2-3 hours, checking to make sure that water doesn't evaporate.
Let condensed milk cool til just warm.
Add enough cooked condensed milk into each mini crust to fill it half way.
Add sliced bananas, and top with a little more condensed milk. Do not overfill. When you add the whipped cream, the volume will increase.
Chill until ready to serve.
When ready to serve, beat whipping cream in chilled bowl until tracks are visible.
Add sugar, to taste, and vanilla.
Continue whipping until stiff peaks form.
Top chilled pies with whipped cream, and shave a little chocolate on top just before serving.
