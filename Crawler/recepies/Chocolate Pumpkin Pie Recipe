For the Pie Crust: Combine the flour, salt, sugar and butter in a food processor and pulse until coarse, with small marbles of butter remaining. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the ice water and pulse until crumbly, and dough holds when squeezed together. Add another sprinkle of water if too dry, but do not overmix.
Transfer dough to a plastic bag, press into a disk, and refrigerate for one hour.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Roll out dough on floured surface. Press into pie plate, trim to leave 1-inch excess around edges, fold under and flute edges. Cut a piece of parchment or nonstick foil to the size of the pie, and use to line pie crust. Fill with pie weights, and bake until golden, about 15 minutes.
Reduce heat to 325F.
For the Pie Filling: In a double boiler, melt chocolate and butter, stirring frequently until smooth, and remove from heat.
In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin, evaporated milk, light brown sugar, eggs, cornstarch, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. Fold in the chocolate mixture, and pour into pie crust. Place pie pan on a baking sheet. Bake at 325F until center of pie has set, about an hour. Refrigerate until cooled completely to serve.
