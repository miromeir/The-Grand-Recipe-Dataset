To make the graham cracker crust, cream butter with granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey in the bowl until mixture is smooth and well-combined.
Add remaining crust ingredients, and stir until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Form dough into a disk, and wrap with plastic wrap.
Chill dough at least 1 hour, or until dough is firm.
Lightly flour a surface, and roll out dough to a 14-inch round.
Place dough in an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
Prick the dough all over with a fork.
Chill dough for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325 F.
Bake chilled crust until golden golden brown and set, about 30 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack.
To make the cream cheese pastry cream, combine 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup sugar in a medium saucepan.
Bring milk mixture just to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together yolks, cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup sugar.
Add remaining 1/2 cup cold milk to yolk mixture, and whisk until smooth.
Add 1/4 cup hot milk mixture to egg mixture, whisking constantly to combine.
Add another 1/4 cup hot milk to egg mixture, whisking constantly until combined.
Whisk egg and milk mixture back to remaining hot milk in saucepan.
Bring entire mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, until thickened.
Remove from heat, and stir in cream cheese and vanilla until smooth and well-combined.
Let pastry cream cool to about room temperature, and then cover the surface directly with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.
Refrigerate until cold.
To assemble, spoon or pipe pastry cream into tart shell, smoothing surface as needed.
Arrange strawberries over pastry cream.
Chill slightly before serving.
