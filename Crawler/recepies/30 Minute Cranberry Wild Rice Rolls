<ingredients>
1/3 c . butter plus extra for brushing on
1 c . milk
2 T . instant yeast
2 T . honey
1/2 tsp . salt
1 large egg
1/2 c . cooked Minute® Multi-Grain Medley cooled to about room temperature
3 c ¼-4 . all-purpose flour
1/2 c . dried cranberries
1/4 c . chopped pecans
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 F. Lightly grease a half sheet pan or a 9x13-inch rimmed cookie sheet. Set aside.
In a small saucepan, melt butter.
When butter is mostly melted, stir in milk, and heat mixture to about 110 F.
Meanwhile, add yeast and honey to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl if mixing by hand).
When milk mixture is at temperature, add to yeast and honey; stir to combine.
Add salt and egg, and stir until combined.
Stir in cooked Multi-Grain Medley.
Stir in 2 cups flour.
Add remaining flour until dough clings to paddle and cleans the sides of the bowl. Dough will still be pretty sticky.
Knead in cranberries and pecans.
With lightly floured hands, shape dough into 12 rolls, and place dough on prepared baking sheet.
Cover, and let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
If you would prefer to use active dry yeast, substitute an equal amount for the instant yeast. After step 5, let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy. Then, continue with the recipe as written.
