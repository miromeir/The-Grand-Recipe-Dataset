Preheat oven to 350 F. Line 14 muffin cups with muffin tin liners; set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together vegetable oil and sugar until combined.
Whisk in eggs and vanilla until well-combined.
Add buttermilk, and whisk in.
Stir in flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined.
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until muffins spring back when lightly touched.
Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, and then remove to wire rack and cool to room temperature.
To make the frosting, beat butter on high for one minute using a hand or stand mixer.
Add powdered sugar, peppermint extract, and 2 tablespoons milk.
Beat on low speed until creamy, adding additional milk as needed.
Stir in food coloring. I used about 5 or 6 drops, but adjust it according to your desired color preference.
Finely chop or roughly baking chocolate.
Fold into frosting.
Top cooled cupcakes with frosting.
Store leftover cupcakes in the fridge.
