<ingredients>
2 1/2 lbs. red potatoes quartered
1/3 c. chicken stock
1 c. ricotta cheese
1 c. sharp cheddar cheese divided
1/3 c. half-and-half or milk
1/4 c. Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Add quartered potatoes to a small slow cooker. I used a 2 qt., and it was full.
Pour in chicken broth.
Cover, and cook on high for about 3-4 hours, or until potatoes are fork-tender.
Using a potato masher, give the potatoes a couple of smashes.
Add ricotta, about 3/4 cup of the shredded cheese, and the half-and-half.
Mash the potatoes a few more times until the ricotta is incorporated.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Remove to serving dish, and top with remaining 1/4 cup shredded cheese and Parmesan.
