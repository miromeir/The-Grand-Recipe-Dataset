Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease 8 full-size donut cups in your donut pans.
In a large saucepan, stir butter and peanut butter together over low heat until melted.
Once butter and peanut butter are melted, removed pan from heat.
In a medium bowl, stir together flour, graham cracker crumbs, sugars, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
Stir milk, egg, and vanilla into peanut butter mixture until well-combined.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Divide batter between donut cups.
Bake for 8-11 minutes, or until donuts spring back when lightly touched.
Remove pans from oven, and sprinkle marshmallows evenly over hot donuts.
Turn oven to broil, and put donuts under broiler until marshmallows are puffed and golden brown, about 1 minute (watch them closely).
Let donuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, and enjoy the donuts while they’re warm.
