Preheat oven to 375 F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Set aside.
With an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar together until fluffy and well-combined.
Add eggs and yolks. Beat until eggs are well-incorporated, about 2-3 minutes.
Stir in vanilla.
Add flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Stir until just incorporated.
Add batter to prepared pan.
Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are very light golden brown. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.
Let the bars cool in the pan until they reach room temperature.
To prepare frosting, beat butter until fluffy.
Stir in vanilla paste or extract.
Add powdered sugar and salt, and mix until combined.
Stir in enough milk to make a spreadable frosting.
