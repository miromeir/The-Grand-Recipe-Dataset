<ingredients>
BROWNIE LAYER
2 oz . semisweet chocolate
1/4 c . butter
1/2 c . granulated sugar
1 large egg
1/2 tsp . vanilla extract
2/3 c . all-purpose flour
pinch of salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. Set aside.
For the brownies, melt together chocolate and butter, whisking until smooth.
Remove from heat, and stir in sugar.
Stir in egg and vanilla until combined.
Add flour and salt; stir until just combined.
Pour into prepared pan, smoothing as needed. Set aside.
For the truffle layer, heat chocolate and cream, whisking until chocolate has melted. Set aside.
With a mixer (either hand or stand), beat sugar and eggs together on high for 2-3 minutes.
With the mixer running on low, stream in chocolate/cream mixture.
Stir in ground almonds and almond extract until just combined.
Pour truffle layer over brownie layer.
Bake for about 25-35 minutes or until center is set and edges begin to look done. Do not overbake. The truffle layer won't be soft and fudgy if the brownies are overbaked.
Remove to wire rack, and let brownies cool to room temperature before cutting.
If you want the brownies to be as fudgy and truffle-like as possible, chill brownies before serving.
