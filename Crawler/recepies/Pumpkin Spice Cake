CAKE
15 ounce package spice cake mix
1 ¼ cups pumpkin puree
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350⁰F.  Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Combine all cake ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl, increase the speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes more, scraping down the sides as needed.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.
Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 25-35 minutes.
Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes.
When completely cool, frost with cream cheese frosting.
To make cream cheese frosting, beat together cream cheese and butter until well-combined.
Add in the powdered sugar one cup at a time, and beat on low for 30 seconds after each addition.
Increase speed to medium and beat for 1-2 minutes or until combined well, scraping down the sides as needed.
Add enough milk to make a spreadable consistency, and then stir in vanilla.
Spread frosting onto cooled cake.
Refrigerate leftover cake.
