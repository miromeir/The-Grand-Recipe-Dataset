<ingredients>
9 cups day-old cubed French bread
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup dark or milk chocolate chips
1 cup granulated sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder¹
4 large eggs
12 oz can evaporated milk²
1/2 cup half-and-half³
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Lightly grease a medium (4-5 quart) crock pot. 
Add bread to crock pot.
Top with chocolate chips.
In a large bowl, whisk together sugars, cocoa powder, eggs, milk, half-and-half, and vanilla. It's ok if it's a little lumpy, but you don't want big piecies of cocoa powder. 
Pour milk mixture over bread, gently pressing bread down as needed.
Place a thin cotton towel over the top of the slow cooker.
Cover, and cook on low for about 3-3 1/2 hours.
