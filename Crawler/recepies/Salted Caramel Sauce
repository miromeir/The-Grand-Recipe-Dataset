<ingredients>
2 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup salted butter at room temperature, cut into pieces, 12 T.
1 cup heavy cream at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon fleur de sel
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Pour the sugar into a large, heavy saucepan.
Heat over medium-high heat, whisking it regularly. The sugar will form clumps and puddles, but just keep whisking it until all of it has melted.
Once all of the sugar has melted, stop whisking it.
Keep cooking the sugar until it reaches a deep golden amber color. Watch the sugar closely as it could easily overcook.
Once the caramel is deep golden amber, add the butter, and whisk until it is completely incorporated. The caramel will bubble up, so be careful.
Remove the pan from heat.
Slowly stream the cream into the caramel, whisking to combine. The caramel will bubble up again, so be careful.
Once the cream has been incorporated, whisk in the vanilla and fleur de sel.
Let the caramel sit for 10-15 minutes.
Pour into a glass jar, and let cool to room temperature (uncovered).
The caramel can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
Warm before using.
