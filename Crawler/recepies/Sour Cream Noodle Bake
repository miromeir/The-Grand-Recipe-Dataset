<ingredients>
1 ¼ lb . 90% or 93% lean ground beef
15 oz . can tomato sauce
2-15 oz . cans diced tomatoes with sweet onions drained
4 cloves garlic minced
1/2 tsp . salt
Fresh ground black pepper
12 oz . dry egg noodles
3/4 c . fat-free plain Greek yogurt*
1 ½ c . low-fat cottage cheese
1 ½ c . 2% sharp cheddar cheese grated
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a baking dish. I like to use a large, shallow baking dish for this pasta. 
In a large skillet, brown ground beef; drain fat, and return to skillet.
Add tomato sauce, tomatoes, garlic, salt, and ground black pepper to ground beef. Stir and simmer while you boil the noodles.
Meanwhile, cook egg noodles according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine yogurt and cottage cheese.
Add cottage cheese mixture to noodles; stir to combine.
To assemble, add half of the noodles to prepared baking dish.
Top noodles with half of the meat sauce.
Sprinkle half the grated cheddar over meat sauce.
Repeat layers with noodles, meat, then a final layer of cheese.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until all of the cheese is melted.
