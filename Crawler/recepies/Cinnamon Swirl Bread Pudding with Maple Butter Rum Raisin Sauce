2 c half-and-half regular or fat-free
4 large eggs
1 tsp . vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
For the bread pudding, preheat oven to 325 F.
Cut bread into cubes, and add to a baking dish.
In a medium bowl, whisk together half and half, eggs, and vanilla extract.
Pour over bread cubes.
Let the bread stand for about 20 minutes to absorb some of the liquid.
Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until done. If it starts to get too brown, tent with foil.
To make the sauce, add maple syrup, raisins, butter, and rum extract to a small saucepan.
Simmer for about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in baking soda.
Serve bread pudding warm or cold topped with sauce.
