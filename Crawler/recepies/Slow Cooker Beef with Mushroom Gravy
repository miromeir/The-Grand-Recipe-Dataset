<ingredients>
3 pound boneless chuck roast
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup diced onion
8 ounces sliced button mushrooms
1/4 cup all-purpose flour divided
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary crushed
1 1/4 cups beef broth
Salt and pepper
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
While skillet is heating up, trim fat from the roast. 
Add 2 teaspoon oil and swirl pan to coat.
Season roast with salt and pepper. 
Brown roast on all sides, and then remove to a plate.
Add remaining teaspoon oil to skillet. 
Stir in onions and mushrooms, and cook until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. 
Sprinkle flour and herbs over vegetables, and stir in. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minutes. 
Whisk in beef broth, scraping up any browned bits from the pan, and bring to boil. 
I cut my roast into chunks and nestle in a single layer in the slow cooker. You can add the roast in a single piece if you prefer. 
Pour the gravy over the roast.
Cook on low for about 8 hours, or until roast shreds easily with two forks. 
In a bowl, add 1 cup of gravy from the slow cooker and remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Stir together until combined.
Whisk beef/flour mixture into slow cooker, and let it continue to cook for 20-30 minutes. 
Serve beef with gravy over noodles, rice, or potatoes. I like to serve it over thick homestyle noodles.
