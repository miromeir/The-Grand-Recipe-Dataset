<ingredients>
1/2 c. warm water , about 105F.
2 c. warm milk , about 105F.
1/4 c. butter , softened
3 T. granulated sugar
1 tsp. salt
2 1/2 T. active dry yeast
6-7 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large bowl, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine water, milk, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes or until foamy.
Stir in butter until combined.
Add 5 cups of flour, and mix by hand or with the paddle attachment until the dough is rough. 
Continue adding flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and blend with the dough hook until a smooth ball begins to form. Knead by hand for about 10 minutes, or by machine for 4-5 minutes until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed.
Cover dough, and let rise for 20 minutes, or until the dough is full and puffy.
Gently deflate and divide dough into 24 pieces. I divide the dough in half, and then divide each half into four pieces. Then, I divide each piece into three pieces. 
Shape into a ball, and place each piece in a well-greased half sheet pan or in two 9x13-inch pans. 
Cover, and let rise for 20-25 minutes, or until well rounded and full looking. 
While the rolls are rising, preheat oven to 350F. 
Bake the rolls for 18-25 minutes, or until golden brown and an internal thermometer reads 190F. You can brush the baked rolls with melted butter if desired.
