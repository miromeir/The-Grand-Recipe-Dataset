1 tsp . vanilla extract
1 1/3 c . all-purpose flour

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 375 F. Line two cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or with an electric mixer), beat together the coconut oil and sugars until fluffy and well-combined.
Beat in egg, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla extract until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir in chocolate chips until just combined.
Drop 1/2 teaspoon scoops of dough onto prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 4-5 minutes. You want the edges to be just barely golden brown.
Remove from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.
