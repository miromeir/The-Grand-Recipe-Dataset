<ingredients>
3/4 cup melted coconut oil * I use extra virgin
1 cup brown sugar , packed
1/3 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup oat flour 1 cup rolled oats ground into flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chunks disks, or chips
1/2 cup shredded coconut optional
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Line two cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or with an electric mixer), beat together the coconut oil and sugars until fluffy and well-combined.
Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla extract until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir in chocolate chunks and coconut until just combined.
Drop scoops of dough onto prepared cookie sheets using a medium cookie scoop (1 ½ tablespoons).
Bake for 7-9 minutes. You want the edges to be just barely golden brown.
Remove from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.
