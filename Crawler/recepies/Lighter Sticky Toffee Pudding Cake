<ingredients>
SAUCE
1/4 c . butter
1/2 c . brown sugar , packed
1/4 c . fat-free half and half
1 tsp . vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
For the sauce, combine the ingredients for the sauce in a medium saucepan.
Bring to boil, and then reduce to simmer gently for a minute or two until thickened and well combined.
Set sauce aside while you make the cakes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin (I like to use a nonstick spray that has flour in it).
Place the dates in large saucepan (you’ll need the room when you add the baking soda) with 1 ¾ cups cold water.
Bring to boil, stirring a little to break up the dates. Let dates simmer for 1 minute before removing from the heat.
Stir in the baking soda (which will cause the mixture to bubble up). Set aside.
Beat the yogurt and sugar together in a with an electric mixer (stand or hand) until well-combined.
Add the eggs, one at a time, occasionally scraping down mixing bowl.
Add the vanilla extract, and stir to combine.
Add the flour and salt. Mix briefly - dough will be lumpy.
Next, add the warm date mixture. Scrape down the sides of bowl as needed. The dough will now be quite watery.
Add the baking powder (this will bubble up also).
Divide the batter evenly between the muffin tins, or pour into pan.
Bake for about 20 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.
Run a thin knife around the cakes to loosen them, and then let them cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes.
Remove the cakes from pan.
Poke little holes all over the warm cake with a toothpick, and pour the sauce over cake.
Serve warm.
