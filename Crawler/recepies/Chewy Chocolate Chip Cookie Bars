<ingredients>
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
6 tablespoons butter melted and cooled slightly
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Adjust the oven rack to middle position.
Grease an 8X8-inch pan. Set aside.
Mix the flour, salt, and baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside.
Whisk the melted butter and sugars in a large bowl until combined.
Add the egg and vanilla and mix well.
Using a rubber spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the butter mixture until just combined; do not overmix.
Fold in the chocolate chips.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with the spatula.
Bake until the top of the bars is light golden brown, slightly firm to the touch, and edges start pulling away from sides of pan, about 15-20 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack to room temperature.
