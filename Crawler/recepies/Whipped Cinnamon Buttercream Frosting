<ingredients>
7 T. all-purpose flour
1 1/2 c . milk
1 1/2 T. pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 c . salted butter at cool room temperature
1 1/2 c . granulated sugar
Pinch of salt
2 tsp. ground cinnamon
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will be the consistency of a thick pancake batter. It should not look wet at this point.
Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
Stir in vanilla.
While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter, sugar, and salt together until light and fluffy on medium high, about 5 minutes.
Then add the completely cooled milk mixture along with the cinnamon.
Beat it for about 5 minutes on medium-high to high until it looks like whipped cream. It may look separated at first, so keep beating it until it comes together and looks like a whipped cream.
