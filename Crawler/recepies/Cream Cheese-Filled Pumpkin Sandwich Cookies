<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together flour, oats, baking powder, spices, and salt. Set aside.
With an electric mixer (either hand or stand), beat together butter and sugars until well-combined.
Beat in eggs, one at a time, until combined.
Stir in vanilla and pumpkin.
Add flour mixture, and stir until just combined.
Stir in nuts, if using.
Using a medium (1 1/2-tablespoon) cookie scoop, drop dough about 2-inches apart on prepared baking sheets.
Bake for about 8-12 minutes, or until cookies are set.
Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on baking sheet, and then remove to wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
Once the cookies have reached room temperature, prepare the cream cheese filling.
Beat together cream cheese and Greek yogurt until well-combined.
Stir in vanilla and enough powdered sugar to make a spreadable filling.
Flip half of the cookies flat-side up.
Spread cookies with filling, and top with a second cookie.
Any remaining cookies should be stored in the fridge.
