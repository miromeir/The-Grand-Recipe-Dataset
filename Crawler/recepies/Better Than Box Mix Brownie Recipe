</details>
<ingredients>
1 cup butter melted
1 ½ cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 large eggs
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a 9x13 baking dish. Set aside.
Stir together the butter, sugars, and vanilla in a large bowl until well-combined.
Stir in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, until thoroughly blended.
Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir in until just incorporated.
Mix in the chocolate morsels.
Pour the batter evenly into the prepared baking dish.
Bake 20-35 minutes. The edges should look dry and set, but there should still be fudgy crumbs when a toothpick is inserted in the middle.
Cool to room temperature before cutting.
