<ingredients>
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
2 large eggs
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil*
1/4 cup low-fat buttermilk
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips , divided
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 F. Paper-line or grease 14 muffin tin cups.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt.
In a separate large bowl, mix together pumpkin, sugars, eggs, oil, and buttermilk until well-combined.
Stir in flour mixture until just combined.
Add 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips, and stir until just incorporated.
Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups.
Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips over the top of the batter.
Bake for 7 minutes.
Reduce heat to 375F.
Continue baking for 13-18 minutes, or until wooden pick inserted in centers comes out clean. A little melted chocolate is ok, but you don't want wet batter coming out on the toothpick.
Cool in pans for 5-10 minutes, and then remove to wire racks to finish cooling.
