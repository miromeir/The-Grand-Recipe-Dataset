<ingredients>
2-10 ounce cans mild green chile enchilada sauce
1/3 cup half-and-half regular or fat-free will work
1/3 cup non-fat Greek yogurt
4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese
4 ounce can diced green chiles
Salt and pepper to taste
2 cups cooked shredded chicken divided
8 medium flour tortillas
2 cups Mexican cheese blend divided, 2% or regular
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
In a saucepan over medium-low heat, stir together enchilada sauce, half-and-half, yogurt, cream cheese, and chiles until cream cheese is melted and sauce is well-combined. You don’t want the sauce to boil, so adjust the heat as necessary.
Add the 1/2 cup chicken to the sauce, and let it warm in sauce for 5 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper as desired.
Meanwhile, warm the tortillas.
To assemble the burritos, divide the remaining chicken among the burritos.
Pour about 2-3 tablespoons of sauce over the chicken, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cheese.
Fold up the bottom and fold down the top of the tortilla.
Roll up the burrito and place seam-side down in the baking dish.
Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Pour the remaining sauce over the burritos.
Sprinkle with remaining 1 ½ cups of cheese.
Cover with greased foil and bake for about 20 minutes, removing the foil during the last 5 minutes of baking. The sauce should be bubbly, and the cheese should be melted.
