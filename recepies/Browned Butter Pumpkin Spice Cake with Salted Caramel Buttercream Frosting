<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour (or use a nonstick spray with flour) to grease 2 (or 4) 9-inch round cake pans.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat.
Cook, whisking occasionally, until the butter turns a golden-brown and begins to smell nutty, about 4 minutes. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined.
Stir in eggs, vanilla, milk, and Greek yogurt until well-combined.
Stir in the flour mixture until just combined.
Add browned butter, and stir until just combined.
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
Bake for about 25-30 minutes for two pans and about 15-20 minutes for 4 pans. Cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes.
Remove cake to wire rack to finish cooling.
Once the layers have reached room temperature, they can be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for later use.
