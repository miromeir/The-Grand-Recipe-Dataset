<ingredients>
1 ¾ c . granulated sugar
1/4 c . unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 c . butter
1/2 c . milk
1 c . peanut butter
1 T . vanilla extract
2 ½ c . rolled oats
1 c . pretzel pieces*
1/2 c . chopped peanuts
1/2 c . caramels , in quarters
1 c . mini marshmallows
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large saucepan or pot, stir together the sugar, cocoa powder, butter, and milk.
Bring to a boil over medium-low heat.
Once the mixture is at a boil, let it cook for 1 minute.
Remove from heat, and stir in peanut butter, vanilla, oats, pretzels, chopped peanuts, and caramels.
Stir in marshmallows until incorporated. If you want the more obvious marshmallow swirl, like in the picture, you want them to just barely be mixed in.
Drop by tablespoonful on waxed paper, and let it sit until cool and set.
