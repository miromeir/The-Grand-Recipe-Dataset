<ingredients>
2 c. fresh strawberries stemmed and quartered
1 c . frozen rhubarb thawed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/3 c . granulated sugar
1/4 c . cornstarch
Topping
1 c . whole-wheat flour
1 ½ c . rolled oats
1 c . brown sugar packed
1/2 c . salted butter cut into pea-sized pieces
1 tsp . vanilla extract
1 tsp . allspice
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine all the strawberries, rhubarb, sugar, and cornstarch in a large bowl. Stir to combine well. Spoon into a shallow baking dish (1 ½ quart).
To make the topping, in a food processor (or with your hands) combine the flour, oats, and brown sugar and pulse (or smoosh) to combine.
Add the butter, vanilla, and allspice and pulse (or smoosh) until the mixture looks dry and crumbly.
Crumble the topping over the filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is hot and bubbly all the way through and the topping looks crispy and light brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.
