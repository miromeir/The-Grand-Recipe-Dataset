<ingredients>
3 cups grated fresh zucchini about 4 zucchini
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup butter melted*
1 cup chopped pecans optional
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans. I like to use nonstick spray with flour. Set aside.
Place the grated zucchini in colander in the sink while you continue.**
Whisk together sugar, eggs, vanilla, salt, and butter in a large bowl.
Add flour, baking soda, and cinnamon, and whisk in until just combined.
Stir in grated zucchini until just incorporated.
Add nuts, if using, and stir in until just combined.
Divide batter between prepared loaf pans.
Bake for 40-60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.***
Cool in pans for 10 minutes.
Run a thin knife around the edges, and remove zucchini bread out onto wire cooling racks to finish cooling.
