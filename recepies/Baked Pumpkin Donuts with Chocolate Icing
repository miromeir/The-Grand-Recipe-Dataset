<instructions>
To make the donuts, preheat oven to 350 F. Spray two (6-count) doughnut pans with a flour-based baking spray, like Baker's Joy.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the butter, yogurt, and pumpkin.
Add the eggs and vanilla; whisk until well-combined.
Whisk in sugar until combined.
Add flour mixture, and whisk until just incorporated.
Spoon batter into prepared pans, smoothing as needed.
Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until set and light golden brown.
Let the donuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes.
While the donuts are baking, prepare the icing.
In a saucepan, bring butter, cocoa powder, and milk to boil.
Remove from heat, and whisk in powdered sugar and vanilla until well-combined.
Remove donuts from pan and place on a wire cooling rack. I place a piece of parchment or a silicone baking mat under the rack to catch drips.
Drizzle icing over warm donuts.
Sprinkle with chopped pecans, if using.
Donuts are best enjoyed warm.
