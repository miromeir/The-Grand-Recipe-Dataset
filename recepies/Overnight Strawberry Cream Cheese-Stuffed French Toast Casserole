8 oz . cream cheese cubed
2 c . sliced strawberries
6 large eggs
1 c . milk
1/4 c . granulated sugar

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Layer half of the bread cubes over the bottom of a greased 8-inch square dish.
Place the cream cheese cubes over the bread cubes.
Layer the sliced strawberries over the cream cheese, and cover with the remaining bread cubes.
Combine the eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, almond extract, and pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Mix well.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread, and smoosh the bread down a little so that the bread can absorb the egg mixture.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Take the pan out of the refrigerator and leave out while preheating the oven to 375.
Uncover and bake for about 30-40 minutes.
Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
