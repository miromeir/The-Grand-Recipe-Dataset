PRETZELS
1 Â½ cups warm water about 85 F
1 tablespoon instant yeast can also use active dry yeast
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3-4 cups all-purpose flour
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if mixing by hand), stir together warm water, yeast, and brown sugar. If using active dry yeast, let yeast mixture stand for 5-10 minutes or until foamy.
Stir in 2 cups flour and salt.
Continue stirring in flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough comes together. Dough will still be a little sticky. If you touch the dough, it should pull with your finger but shouldn't come off on your finger.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap, and let it rise for about 10 minutes.
While dough is resting, preheat oven to 425 F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
To prepare the water bath, stir together remaining 2 cups warm water and 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a medium bowl.
Divide dough into 8 pieces, and shape each piece into pretzel.
Submerge shaped pretzel in water bath, and then place it on prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown.
Top with desired toppings.
