<instructions>
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
Grind two cups of oats into flour (a blender or food processor should do this).
In a medium bowl, whisk together oat flour, remaining 1 cup oats, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt.
With an electric mixer (either hand or stand), beat together the coconut oil and sugar until combined.
Beat in the eggs and the vanilla until combined.
Stir in the flour mixture just until combined.
Stir in the carrots, coconut, and nuts, if using.
Cover, and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
Using a 1 Â½ tablespoon cookie scoop, drop about batter about 2-inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Gently flatten slightly, if desired.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until cookie is set and very lightly browned at the edges.
Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for at least 5 minutes.
Transfer to wire cooling rack to cool to room temperature before icing.
To make icing, beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and 2 tablespoons milk until well-combined.
Add additional milk as needed to get to desired consistency.
Drizzle icing over cooled cookies.
Cover, and store leftover cookies in the fridge.
