<ingredients>
DOUGH
3/4 c . warm milk about 105 F
1 T ½ . active dry yeast
1/2 c . granulated sugar
6 T . butter at room temperature
2 large eggs
4 c . all-purpose flour plus more for dusting
1 tsp . kosher salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Grease a 12-cup muffin tin; set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if mixing by hand), combine the warm milk, yeast, and sugar. Let stand 5-10 minutes until foamy.
Add butter to the yeast mixture. Mix until the butter is broken up, about 1 minute.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time.
Add the flour and salt, and mix at low speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the side of the bowl.
Increase the speed to medium, and mix the dough for 2 minutes longer. The dough will still be soft and a little sticky.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let stand for 10 minutes.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to a 11x17-inch rectangle.
In a small bowl, prepare the filling.
Mix together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and apple.
Brush the 2 tablespoons of melted butter over the dough and sprinkle evenly with the apple-cinnamon mixture.
Beginning at a long edge, roll up the dough as tightly as possible, pinching the seam.
Cut the rolled dough into twelve pieces, and set them in the muffin cups cut side up.
Cover, and let stand for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 F.
Set the muffin tin on a baking sheet, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.
While the buns are baking, make the glaze.
Combine the brown sugar, butter, heavy whipping cream, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan.
Stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes.
Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt, vanilla, and baking soda. The glaze will foam up a little, so allow room for that.
Let the buns cool in pan for 5 minutes.
Remove the buns from the pan, and then pour the glaze over the hot buns. Serve warm.
Note – The glaze will thicken as it sits. If you like a thicker sauce, make it during the second rise so it can sit longer.
