<ingredients>
PUMPKIN CAKE BARS
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar packed
1/2 cup granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups pumpkin purée
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice*
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease and flour a large rimmed half-sheet pan, about 18x 13-inches. I like to use a nonstick baking spray with flour.
Beat the oil and sugars together until well blended.
Beat in the eggs, scraping down the sides as needed.
Mix in the pumpkin purée and vanilla.
Stir the baking soda, baking powder, salt, and spice into the wet ingredients, then stir in the flour, beating gently to combine.
Stir in the nuts.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.
Cool the cake in the pan.
To make the frosting, beat the cream cheese and butter together.
Mix in the powdered sugar.
Stir in enough milk to make a spreadable frosting.
Frost the bars, and sprinkle with the toasted nuts.
Store leftovers covered in the fridge.
