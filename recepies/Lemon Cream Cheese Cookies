In a medium bowl, whisk flour, corn starch, baking soda, and salt together.
In a large bowl, stir melted butter, cream cheese, and sugar together until well-combined.
Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla; stir well to combine.
Stir in lemon juice and lemon zest.
Stir in flour mixture, and mix until just incorporated.
Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hou8-24 hours.
Toward the end of the chilling time, preheat oven to 350 F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Using a medium cookie scoop (1 ½ tablespoons), scoop dough. The dough will be very sticky, so it try to handle it as little as possible.
Roll dough in granulated sugar, and then place dough balls about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until middle is set and edges are very lightly golden brown.
