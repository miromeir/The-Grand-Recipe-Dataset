<ingredients>
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup diced onion
3 cloves garlic minced
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
2-15 ounce cans diced tomatoes undrained (I like to use the tomatoes with onion and garlic)
15 ounces tomato sauce
1 cup water
10 ounce package wide egg noodles*
4 ounces part skim ricotta cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend
Basil
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large skillet, brown ground beef over medium-low heat.
Drain grease from ground beef, and return it to the skillet.
Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Add the garlic and Italian seasoning, and cook for 30 seconds.
Stir in tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, and egg noodles.
Cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until noodles are al dente.
Stir in ricotta, and add salt and pepper to taste.
Remove from heat, and top with Italian cheese blend.
Let the lasagna sit for about 5 minutes for cheese to melt. If I already have the oven on, I just pop the pan in (make sure itâ€™s oven safe first, though) and let the cheese melt. It takes about 3-4 minutes.
Top with fresh basil just before serving.
