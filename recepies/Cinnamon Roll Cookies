CINNAMON COOKIES
1 c . butter
1 c . brown sugar
1/3 c . granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 T . vanilla extract
3 c ½ . all-purpose flour
2 T . cornstarch
1 tsp ½ . baking soda
1 tsp . ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp . kosher salt or 1/4 tsp. salt

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Let the butter cook until it just starts to brown.
Pour the melted butter into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using an electric mixer).
Add the sugars, and beat together until fluffy and well-combined.
Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla extract until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Cover, and refrigerate (or freeze if you’re in a hurry) for at least 6 hours (or 4 hours in the freezer). If you put the dough in the freezer, you'll need to set it out while the oven preheats.
When you’re ready to bake the cookies, preheat oven to 350 F. Line two cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
Drop scoops of dough onto prepared cookie sheets using a medium cookie scoop (1 ½ tablespoons).
Bake for 7-9 minutes. You want the edges to be just barely golden brown.
Remove from oven, and let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.
To make the filling, beat cream cheese and yogurt together until well-combined.
Add the vanilla extract, and stir until it’s incorporated.
Add enough powdered sugar to make it spreadable.
Once the cookies have cooled, spread half of them with the cream cheese filling.
Top with the remaining cookies.
Store any leftover cookies in the refrigerator.
This recipe makes about 28 cookie sandwiches.
