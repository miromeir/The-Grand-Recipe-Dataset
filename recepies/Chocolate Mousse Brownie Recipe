Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease or use parchment paper to line a 9x9-inch baking pan.

Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla.
Let mixture cool for about 5 minutes.
Whisk in eggs until combined.
Add flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Whisk in until just incorporated.
Pour batter into prepared pan, spreading batter as needed.
Bake for 20-30 minutes. The edges should look done, but the center should still look shiny.

Cool completely.
In a separate bowl, beat whipping cream to stiff beats.
