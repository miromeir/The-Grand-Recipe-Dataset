<ingredients>
3 c . powdered sugar
3/4 c . unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 tsp . salt
4 large egg whites*
1 T . pure vanilla extract
1/2 c . semisweet mini chocolate chips
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats. This is the set I use (affiliate link). Spray mats with nonstick cooking spray. You can also line with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar with cocoa powder and salt.
Stir in the vanilla and egg whites.
Whisk just until the batter is moistened.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Scoop the batter by the tablespoonful onto the baking sheets. Leave enough space between each cookie for them to spread (about 2 ½ ” of space between each cookie).
Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the tops are glossy and lightly cracked.
Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet, and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
