<ingredients>
CHOCOLATE CAKE
1/2 cup cajeta or caramel sauce plus extra for drizzling at the end
1 cup butter at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup Mexican Coca-Cola*
1/2 cup buttermilk regular or low-fat
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and lightly flour a 10-15 cup bundt pan. I use a nonstick spray with flour in it like Baker's Joy. 
Drizzle the bottom and sides of the bundt pan with the cajeta. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until well-combined.
Beat in the eggs and vanilla until incorporated.
Add flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir until just incorporated.
Stir in the coke and buttermilk until combined.
Pour cake batter into prepared pan.
To make the flan, add the cream cheese and eggs to a blender. Mix until smooth and well-combined.
Blend in the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla until combined.
Pour the flan mixture over the cake batter. Some of the flan may swirl into the cake batter, and that's ok.
Cover the bundt pan tightly with aluminum foil.
Place the bundt pan into a larger pan, and add 1 inch of hot (not boiling) water to make a water bath. 
Bake for about 90 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean.
Uncover, and let cake cool in the pan for 1 hour.
Cake can be served warm or chilled for a few hours and served cold.
Drizzle with additional cajeta just before serving, if desired.
