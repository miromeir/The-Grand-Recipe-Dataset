<ingredients>
7 medium sauce apples peeled , cored and sliced (I used a combination of Gala, Granny Smith, and Golden Delicious apples)
1/2-1 c . cinnamon imperial candies (I like 3/4 cup).
1/3 c . apple cider
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Place apples, candies, and cider in a slow cooker (5 qt. or smaller).
Give it a quick toss.
Cover, and cook on low for 7-8 hour or on high for 3-4 hours, or until it reaches the desired consistency.
Applesauce can be pureed if you would like it to be smooth, and it's good served warm or chilled.
