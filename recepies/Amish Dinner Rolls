<ingredients>
2 large eggs
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 tablespoons butter softened
1 cup unseasoned mashed potatoes lightly packed*
2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
3/4 cup lukewarm water (water in which the potatoes were boiled if possible)
4 1/4-5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Add eggs, salt, sugar, butter, mashed potatoes, yeast, water, and 3 cups of flour to a large bowl.
Mix until combined.
Continue adding flour until soft dough forms.
Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
Let the dough rise until it's doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.
Gently deflate the dough.
Add to heavily floured surface, and knead in additional flour to form a soft, workable dough.
Divide dough into 24 balls.
Place the rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch pan.
Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let them rise for about 1 1/2-2 hours, or until they're puffy. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350F.
Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until they're golden brown and feel set.
Brush with melted butter, if desired.
