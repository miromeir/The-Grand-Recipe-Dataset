<ingredients>
1/2 c . butter
2 c . milk
4 large eggs separated
1/8 tsp . cream of tartar
1 c Â¾ . powdered sugar
1 tsp . vanilla
1 T . + 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan; set aside.
Melt the butter; set aside.
Heat the milk until it is lukewarm; set aside.
Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar to stiff peaks. Set aside.
In a separate large bowl, mix together egg yolks and powdered sugar (will be very thick).
Whisk in the melted butter, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice.
Stir in the flour.
Whisk in the pumpkin and milk until combined.
Carefully fold in the egg whites.
Pour prepared pan, and bake for 40-50 minutes. Cake will look done on top but still be soft in the middle (will jiggle when you gently shake the pan).
Let the cake cool to room temperature, and then chill until ready to serve.
Top with a dusting of powdered sugar, if desired.
