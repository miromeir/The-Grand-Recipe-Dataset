<ingredients>
2 tablespoons butter
2 cup steel cut oats
3 cups water
2 cups evaporated milk or nondairy milk*
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Turn Instant Pot to SAUTE and melt butter.
Add steel cut oats, and toast, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes.
Stir in the water and milk. Using 2 cups of milk will give you thicker oats, and using 3 cups of milk will give you thinner oats.
Cover and turn the vent at the top to SEALING.
Press the MANUAL button and then decrease the time to 10 minutes on HIGH pressure.
After the Instant Pot has finished cooking, allow the pressure to naturally release for 20 minutes.
Turn the vent to the VENTING position to release any remaining pressure.
Remove the lid, and stir the oats.
Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to 4 days.
