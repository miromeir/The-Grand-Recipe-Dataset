Southwestern Twice Baked Potatoes

<ingredients>
4 medium baking potatoes
1/2 cup plain non-fat Greek yogurt
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon dry ranch seasoning mix
2 avocados
2 slices bacon cooked and crumbled
Salt and pepper to taste
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Bake potatoes until done. I like to rub the skin with olive oil and then sprinkle them with kosher salt before baking. I start the potatoes off in the microwave for 5 minutes and then finish them until fork-tender in a 350 F oven for 30 minutes.
Cut a slit lengthwise in the potatoes. Be careful as some steam and heat will be released. Scoop out the insides into a medium bowl, leaving a sturdy shell of potato and skin.
Add the yogurt, cheese, ranch seasoning, and avocado insides. Stir well to combine.
Stir in crumbled bacon, reserving 2 tablespoons.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Scoop mixture back into potato shells.
Return potatoes to the oven, and bake for 10 minutes, or until mixture is warmed through.
To serve, top with remaining 2 tablespoons bacon.
