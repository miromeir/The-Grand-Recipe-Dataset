2 T . vanilla extract

<instructions>
Preheat oven to 275 F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with silicone baking liners.
Divide the nuts between the two baking sheets.
In a large saucepan, heat brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup over medium-low heat, stirring regularly.
Bring to a boil, and stir constantly for 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla and baking soda. Stir to combine.
Pour half of the caramel over each pan of nuts.
Using a rubber spatula, toss nuts to coat. The nuts may clump together, and thatâ€™s ok.
Bake, stirring every 10 minutes for 40 minutes.
Remove from oven, and stir one more time.
Spread nuts in an even layer, and let cool to room temperature.
Break into pieces, and enjoy!
