<ingredients>
CAKE
15.25 oz. white cake mix
3 large eggs
1/2 c . milk
1/2 c . water
1/4 c . butter melted
2 tsp . vanilla extract
1-2 tsp . almond extract*
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside.
In a large bowl, mix together cake mix, eggs, milk, water, butter, and extracts on low for 30 seconds.
Turn speed up to medium, and mix together for 1-2 minutes, or until combined.
Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Using the handle of a wooden spoon (or similar instrument), poke holes in the cake (I poke about 35).
Pour the fruit filling over warm cake, gently spreading as necessary.
Let cake cool to room temperature.
To make the frosting, beat together cream cheese and butter until combined.
Add powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon milk, and extracts. Beat together until well-combined.
Mix in milk to reach desired consistency.
Spread frosting over room temperature cake. The easiest way to do this is to drop frosting evenly over cake and then gently spread to combine.
Chill until ready to serve.
Just before serving, top with fresh raspberries and sliced almonds.
Cover and chill any leftovers.
