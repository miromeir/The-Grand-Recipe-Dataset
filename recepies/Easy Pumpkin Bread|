<ingredients>
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice*
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
2 large eggs
15 oz can pumpkin puree**
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 325F. Grease and flour two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans.***
In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside. 
In a large bowl, whisk oil and sugar together. Mixture will look like wet sand. 
Whisk in eggs until well-combined. 
Add the pumpkin puree and whisk until well-combined. 
Whisk in the flour mixture until just combined. Overmixing the bread will cause it to be tough. 

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.  
Bake for 40-60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 
Let the loaves cool in the pans for 10 minutes, and then remove to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
