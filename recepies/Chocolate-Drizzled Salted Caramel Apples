Place a popsicle stick in each apple.
Bring a pot of water to boiling.
Briefly dip the apples in the boiling water.
Let apple dry.
In a heavy saucepan, melt caramels and vanilla over lowest heat, stirring constantly.
Once caramels have melted, dip the apples in so that it's covered about 3/4 of the way up the apple, letting the excess run off.
Place caramel-coated apple on the greased parchment paper.
Once the caramel has set up, melt the chocolate and coconut oil together in a separate saucepan, stirring regularly, over lowest heat.
Drizzle melted chocolate over caramel, and dip in chopped peanuts.
Sprinkle with finishing salt, if desired.
Let the dipped apples sit for about 10 minutes, and then place in refrigerator for 1 hour to set caramel and chocolate.
