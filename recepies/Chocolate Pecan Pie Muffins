CHOCOLATE MUFFINS
1 Â¾ c . all-purpose flour
1/2 c . brown sugar , packed
1/4 c . unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp . baking powder
1 tsp . baking soda
1/4 tsp . salt

<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together water, oil, vinegar, vanilla, and egg until well-combined.
Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined.
Scoop batter into prepared tins. I used an ice cream scoopful per tin.
Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffin comes out clean.
Cool in tin for 5 minutes.
While the muffins are still warm, make a dent in each one.
Cook brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, egg, cornstarch, and vanilla over medium heat, stirring, until thick.
Stir chopped pecans, and spoon the pecan mixture over the muffins.
