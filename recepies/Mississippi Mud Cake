<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 17Ã—11 inch rimmed cookie sheet.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan, heat butter, cocoa, and water in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring to boil.
Once at a boil, pour over the flour mixture, and stir to combine.
Add the buttermilk, yogurt, eggs, and vanilla. Stir until just combined.
Pour batter into prepared baking pan.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cake springs back lightly when gently pressed.
Toward the end of the baking time, the prepare the icing.
For the icing, combine the butter, cocoa, and buttermilk in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Remove from heat, and add the powdered sugar, vanilla, and nuts (if using). Stir to combine.
Once the cake has finished baking, remove from oven and sprinkle evenly with marshmallows.
Return cake to oven, and bake until marshmallows are puffed and golden, about 3 minutes.
Remove cake from oven, and gently press Nilla wafers into marshmallows.
Pour icing over wafers, and spread icing evenly across cake.
Let cake cool to room temperature before cutting and serving. This cake is better once it has had a chance to sit for a while so that the cookies can soften.
