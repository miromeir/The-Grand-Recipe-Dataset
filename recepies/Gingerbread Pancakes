1 tsp . baking powder
1/2 tsp . baking soda
1/2 tsp . salt
1 tsp . ground cinnamon
3/4 tsp . ground ginger
1/4 tsp . allspice
1/4 c . dark brown sugar , firmly packed

<instructions>
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and allspice.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, eggs, molasses, 2 tablespoons melted butter, yogurt, and water.
Add the brown sugar mixture to the flour mixture; stir until just blended. There will be some small lumps.
Heat a large griddle or pan over medium heat until hot.
Brush with some of the remaining tablespoon of melted butter.
Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the hot surface.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until small bubbles appear and the edges start to look dry, about 3-4 minutes.
Flip the pancakes over; cook until lightly browned on the other side, about 1 minute more.
Repeat with the remaining batter to make about 8 pancakes, each about 4 inches in diameter.
