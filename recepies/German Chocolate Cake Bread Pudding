<ingredients>
1 oz loaf French bread 12 .
2 c . fat-free half-and-half
4 large eggs
1/4 c . unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp . vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
For the bread pudding, grease a 2.2 quart baking dish.
Cut bread into cubes, and add half to a baking dish.
In a medium bowl, whisk together half and half, eggs, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract.
Pour half over bread cubes.
Repeat with remaining bread and chocolate mixture.
Let the bread stand to absorb some of the liquid while you heat oven to 325 F.
Bake for 40-55 minutes, or until done. If it starts to get too brown, tent with foil.
Remove from oven, and turn oven to broil.
Mix together topping ingredients, and spread over the top of the warm bread pudding.
Return to oven, and broil for 2-3 minutes, or until hot and bubbly and just beginning to brown.
Remove from oven.
Just before serving, heat butter and brown sugar in microwave for 30 seconds.
Stir in half and half, and continue to stir and heat in 15 second intervals until brown sugar has melted.
Serve hot or cold topped with sauce.
