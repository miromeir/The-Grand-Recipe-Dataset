<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together cake flour, baking powder, and salt.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or with an electric mixer), beat together butter, sugar, and yogurt until well-combined.
Stir in 1 tablespoon vanilla until combined.
Add eggs one at time, mixing well after each addition.
On low, stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir in milk until combined.
Scoop out 2 ½ cups of the batter, and place it into a separate bowl.
Stir cocoa powder and milk into the 2 ½ cups of batter until well-combined.
Add remaining 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to original batter.
Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, drop one scoop of plain batter into prepared bundt pan.
Drop one scoop of chocolate swirl batter on top of plain batter.
Continue to alternate between plain and chocolate batters until both batters are gone.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
Invert the cake onto wire rack, and cool completely.
If you want to use a chocolate glaze, here is the recipe for one I used.
