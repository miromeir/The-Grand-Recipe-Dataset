<ingredients>
BROWNIE BITES
12 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips 60-70% cacao
1/2 cup butter
3 large eggs
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar packed
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder not Dutch-processed
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 375 F. Grease and flour a 12-cup muffin tin. Set aside. Make sure you really grease the muffin tin so that the brownies don't stick.
Melt chocolate and butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until melted and well-combined.
Remove from heat, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs, sugars, vanilla, and salt on high speed 5 minutes, or until the batter is thick and creamy.
Reduce the speed to low, and mix in the melted chocolate until well-combined.
Stir in flour and cocoa powder just until combined. The batter should be the consistency of a thick brownie batter at this point.
Divide batter among muffin cups. They should be about 3/4 full.
Bake 15-25 minutes. The brownies will be puffed and the top should be shiny and cracked. Bake toward the lower end of the baking time if you want fudgier middles and longer if you want a cakier brownie.
Let cool in muffin tin for 10 minutes, and then remove to a wire rack to finish cooling.
To make the coconut topping, stir all ingredients together in a small bowl.
Top each brownie with a scoop of coconut filling.
To make the chocolate ganache, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
Heat cream to simmer.
Pour over chocolate, and cover, without stirring, for 5 minutes.
Uncover, and stir until chocolate has melted and cream is incorporated.
Let stand for 5-10 minutes to thicken.
Top coconut with chocolate ganache, and set an almond on top of chocolate.
