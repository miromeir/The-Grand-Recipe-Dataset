<ingredients>
1/2 c. salted butter, softened , or same amount unsalted butter + 1/4 tsp. salt
1 c. granulated sugar
3/4 c. powdered sugar
2 large eggs
1/4 c. fresh lemon juice
1 T. lemon zest

</ingredients>
<instructions>
In the bowl of a standing mixer on medium speed, cream the butter and sugars together until well blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a time, until blended.
Add lemon juice and zest, mixing until blended.
In one addition, add salt (if using), baking powder and flour. Mix until just blended.
Cover and chill dough overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
Drop by rounded scoopfuls (I used a small cookie scoop) onto prepared baking sheets. Bake until edges are firm with no color, about 7-10 minutes.
Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks and let cool.
Once cool, dust with powdered sugar.
