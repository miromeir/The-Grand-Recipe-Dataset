Preheat oven to 375 F, and line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together coconut oil and sugars until fluffy well-combined, about 3-4 minutes.
Beat in egg, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Form into a rectangle about 14x3-inches.
Bake for 6-8 minutes.
Remove from oven, and let cool for about 5 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Using a serrated knife, cut into 1-inch strips.
For the drizzle, microwave almond bark in a microwave-safe bowl for 30 seconds.
Add coconut oil, stir, and continue microwaving in 15-second intervals until smooth and melted.
Drizzle over cookie sticks, and sprinkle with crushed candy canes.
