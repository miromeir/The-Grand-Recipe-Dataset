<ingredients>
1 large ripe banana , mashed
1/2 c . plain , nonfat Greek yogurt
1/4 c . crunchy or creamy peanut butter
1/4 c . vegetable oil
2 large eggs
1/2 c . brown sugar
1/4 c . granulated sugar
1 ½ c . all-purpose flour
1/4 c . cocoa powder
1 tsp . baking soda
1/2 tsp . salt
1/2 c . semisweet mini chocolate chips , divided
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8x4-inch baking pan; set aside.
In a large bowl, stir together banana, yogurt, peanut butter, and vegetable oil until combined.
Add eggs, and stir until incorporated.
Stir in sugars until well-combined.
Add flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir until just combined.
Stir in 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
Pour batter into pan, smoothing as needed.
Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips over the batter
Bake for about 35-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. It’s ok if it has some melted chocolate, but it shouldn't have any crumbs.
Let it cool for 5-10 minutes in the pan.
Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the bread.
Remove from pan, and let cool on a wire cooling rack.
