</ingredients>
<instructions>
Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add oil.
Add mushrooms, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. 
Let mushrooms cook 5-10 minutes, or until softened.
Pour mushrooms into slow cooker. I use a 5 quart slow cooker.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in now empty skillet.
Add onion, tomato paste, garlic, and thyme. Cook until onions have softened, stirring regularly, about 5-10 minutes.
Stir in flour, and cook for 1 minute.
Whisk in broth and wine, scraping up any browned bits. Be sure to whisk until there are no flour lumps.
Pour into slow cooker. 
Stir in soy sauce and bay leaves.
Season beef chunks with salt and pepper.
Add beef chunks to slow cooker, pushing beef into sauce.
Cover, and cook until beef is tender, on low for 9-11 hours or on high for 5-7 hours. 
Skim any accumulated fat from the surface.
Discard bay leaves.
Add 1 cup of cooking liquid from slow cooker to a bowl.
Stir in sour cream and mustard, and then return mixture to slow cooker, stirring to combine.
Season with additional salt, pepper, and dill to taste.
