<ingredients>
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar packed
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour*
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt**
1 1/2 cups M&Ms
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.
In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.
Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.
Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.
Stir in M&Ms.
Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place on baking sheet.
Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.***
