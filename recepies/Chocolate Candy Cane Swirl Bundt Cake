Preheat oven to 350 Grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together cake flour, baking powder, and salt.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or with an electric mixer), beat together butter, sugar, and yogurt until well-combined.
Stir in vanilla until combined.
Add eggs one at time, mixing well after each addition.
On low, stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Stir in milk until combined.
Scoop out 3 cups of the batter, and place it into a separate bowl.
Stir cocoa powder and milk into the 3 cups of batter until well-combined. Set aside.
Scoop out 2 cups of original batter, and place it in a separate bowl.
Stir in red food coloring, peppermint extract, and crushed peppermint candies until combined; set aside.
Pour about half of the chocolate batter into the bottom of the prepared bundt pan.
Layer peppermint batter, original batter, and then remaining half of chocolate batter. You don’t need to swirl it.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
Invert the cake onto wire rack, and cool completely.
