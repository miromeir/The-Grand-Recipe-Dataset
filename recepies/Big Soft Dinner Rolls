2 Â¼ teaspoons active dry yeast (1 pkg.)
1/4 c . warm water 110-115 F

</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small bowl, combine sugar, yeast, and warm water. Let yeast sit until it foams (5-10 minutes).
In a the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the warm milk, melted butter, egg, and salt.
Add the yeast mixture to the milk mixture; stir to combine.
Stir in 3 cups of flour. 
Switch to dough hook. Stir in remaining flour as needed until dough clings to dough hook but clears the sides of the bowl. 
Knead for 5-10 minutes to make a smooth, elastic dough.
Grease a bowl and place dough in, turning to grease the top. Cover with a clean, damp cloth.
Place in a warm location; let rise until doubled in size, about 60-90 minutes.
Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.
Punch down the dough and divide into 24 pieces.
Roll each piece into a ball. Place two balls in each muffin cup.
Cover with a clean towel.
Let rolls rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Bake rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until tops are browned and rolls are done. (Check rolls after 15 minutes, and cover loosely with foil to prevent excess browning, if needed.)
