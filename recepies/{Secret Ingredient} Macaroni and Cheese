<ingredients>
2 c . chopped cauliflower florets
1 (12 oz.) package dry pasta
1 (12 oz.) can fat-free evaporated milk
1 (8 oz.) package reduced-fat cream cheese, in 8 pieces
1 (8 oz.) package sharp white cheddar cheese, grated or in small cubes, divided
1 tsp . dried mustard
1/2 tsp . garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
butter cracker crumbs (optional)
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 2.5-quart baking dish.
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
Add cauliflower, and cook until tender, about 10-15 minutes.
Once the cauliflower is tender, remove from water, puree until smooth, and then set aside.
I skim the cauliflower out so that I can use the boiling water for the pasta, too. Once you have removed the cauliflower from the boiling water, add the pasta, and cook according to the package directions.
Meanwhile, begin the cheese sauce.
Add evaporated milk to a large saucepan.
Warm milk to simmer, and then add cream cheese.
Stir until cream cheese melts.
Add the cauliflower puree, 1 cup cheddar cheese, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper; stir to combine.
Pour half noodles into prepared baking dish.
Cover with half of the cheese sauce.
Add the remaining noodles.
Pour remaining sauce over noodles, and pour remaining cheese over sauce.
Cover tightly with foil, and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
Remove foil, and sprinkle with crumbs, if using, and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
