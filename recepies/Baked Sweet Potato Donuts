1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 Grease 2 6-well doughnut pans with cooking spray. Set aside.
Stir together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
Whisk together brown sugar, butter, oil, buttermilk, egg, egg yolk, sweet potatoes, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.
Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture, stirring just until no streaks of flour remain.
Spoon mixture into prepared doughnut pans. They will be full.
Bake until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 10-15 minutes.
Remove doughnuts from pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
Once the donuts have cooled, prepare the glaze.
To make the glaze, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat just until it begins to brown, about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, and whisk in brown sugar, cream, and maple syrup. Return pan to low heat and cook until bubbly, about 30 seconds.
Remove from heat, and whisk in powdered sugar, vanilla, and maple flavor until smooth.
Dip tops of cooled donuts into glaze, and return to cooling rack.
Sprinkle with pecans, if using.
Let glaze set up before serving, about 10-15 minutes.
