<ingredients>
2 c . all-purpose flour
1 tsp . baking powder
1 tsp . baking soda
1/4 tsp . salt
1/3 c . brown sugar
1 tsp . cinnamon
1/4 tsp . nutmeg
1 ½ c . low-fat buttermilk
1 T . vanilla extract
1 c . mashed ripe bananas (about 2-3 large bananas)
2 T . butter , melted
2 T . pearl sugar or about 6 sugar cubes , broken into chunks
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg; set aside.
In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, vanilla, bananas, and melted butter.
Add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture, and stir until just combined.
Spray waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray and add batter according to waffle iron’s directions (I have a 4-square waffle iron, and I used 1 cup of batter per waffle).
Sprinkle waffle with pearl sugar or broken sugar cubes.
Cook waffles according to your waffle iron’s directions.
Be careful removing waffle from iron – the sugar will caramelize and is extremely hot.
