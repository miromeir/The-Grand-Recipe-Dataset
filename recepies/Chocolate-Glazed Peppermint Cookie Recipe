Stir in flour until just incorporated.
Divide the dough into two pieces, and shape each piece into a 10-inch roll.
Wrap each roll into plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Cut each roll into 1/4-inch slices, and place 1-inch apart on cookie sheet.
Bake for 6-8 minutes, or until the edges are firm.
Let cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes, and them remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
To make the glaze, melt chocolate chips and shortening in a heavy saucepan.
Remove from heat, and stir in peppermint extract.
Dip cookies in glaze, and place on parchment or waxed paper.
Sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy, and chill to firm up.
