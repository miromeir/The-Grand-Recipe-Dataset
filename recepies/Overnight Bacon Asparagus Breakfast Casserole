<ingredients>
10 c . sourdough bread cubes in 3/4-inch cubes
1 lb . asparagus ends snapped off, cut into 1? pieces
1 c . finely chopped onion
4-5 slices thick-cut bacon cooked and roughly chopped
2 c . shredded sharp cheddar cheese divided
8 large eggs
1 ½ c . low-fat milk
1/2 tsp . salt
1/2 tsp . pepper
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper, and grease a 2-quart casserole dish or an 8? x 11? pan.
Spread bread cubes evenly on the baking sheet.
Heat the bread in the oven for 10 minutes; it won’t color, but will dry out a bit.
Cook asparagus very briefly, about 1 ½ minutes in the microwave. You want them to be crisp but not hard.
Layer the bread cubes, asparagus, onion, bacon, and 1 cup of the cheese in the baking dish.
Mix together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper and pour over the bread mixture, pressing the bread gently into the liquid.
Cover the pan, and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 6 hours.
Bake, uncovered, in a preheated 375°F oven, for about 40-50 minutes, or until it’s puffed and golden. A knife blade inserted into the center will come out clean.
Sprinkle the top with the remaining cup of cheese, and return to oven for about 5 minutes to melt the cheese.
Remove the strata from the oven, and allow it to rest for 15 minutes before serving.
