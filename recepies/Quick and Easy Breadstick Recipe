<ingredients>
1 ½ cups warm water about 105 F
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter melted
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2-1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl), stir together the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let stand for 5-10 minutes or until foamy.
Mix in flour and salt.
Knead dough for three minutes.
Cover, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
Grease an 11X17-inch baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
On a floured surface, roll out the dough into about a 12/16-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. 
Cut the dough in half width-wise with a pizza cutter. Cut into 8 strips lengthwise for a total of 16 strips.
Twist each strip slightly (or leave them as strips), and place about 1/2-inch apart on the baking sheet.
Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rise 30 minutes. Toward the end of the resting time, preheat oven to 375 F.
Bake 12-20 minutes or until golden brown.
While breadsticks are baking, stir together butter, seasoning, and garlic salt.
Brush over hot breadsticks, and then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
