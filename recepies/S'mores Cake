<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, graham cracker crumbs, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
Add buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla.
Stir until just combined.
Add chocolate chips, and mix until just incorporated.
Pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove from oven, and let the cake cool for about 5 minutes.
Once you remove the cake from the oven, turn the oven to "Broil".
Meanwhile, warm marshmallow creme until spreadable (about 30 seconds in the microwave).
Pour creme evenly over cake, and gently spread to cover the warm cake
Place marshmallows evenly over the top of the cake.
Sprinkle remaining chocolate chips in between marshmallows.
Return cake to oven, and broil until marshmallows are puffed and golden. Watch carefully because the marshmallows can burn quickly.
Remove from oven.
Serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkling with extra graham cracker crumbs just before serving.
