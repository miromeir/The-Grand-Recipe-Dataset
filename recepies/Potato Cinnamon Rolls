<instructions>
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if mixing by hand), dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.
Let yeast mixture stand 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.
Add cornstarch, mashed potatoes, milk, butter, egg, salt, vanilla; stir to combine.
Stir in 2 cups flour until incorporated.
Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.
If mixing with the stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead for 4-5 minutes. If mixing by hand, knead until smooth and elastic on a lightly floured surface for about 6-8 minutes.
Place in a greased bowl, and cover.
Let rise until double, about 1 ½ hours.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 13x9-inch rectangle.
Brush dough with melted 2 tablespoons of melted butter.
For the filling, stir together sugars and cinnamon, and sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over melted butter.
Roll dough up, starting with a long side.
Cut into 12 pieces.
To prepare the pan, brush a 13x9-inch pan with 2 tablespoons butter.
Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the melted butter in the pan.
Place cinnamon roll slices, cut side down, in prepared pan.
Cover, and let cinnamon rolls rise for 45 minutes – 1 hour.
Toward the end of the second rising time, preheat oven to 350 F.
Bake cinnamon rolls for 20-30 minutes, or until light golden brown.
Remove the cinnamon rolls from the oven, and let them cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.
While the cinnamon rolls are cooling, prepare the icing, if using.
In a medium bowl, stir together icing ingredients.
Drizzle over cinnamon rolls, and serve warm.
