<ingredients>
1/2 cup butter
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate chopped*
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large eggs
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment, leaving a slight overhang on all sides.
Add butter and chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave for 30 seconds. 
Stir, and continue microwaving and stirring in 15 second intervals until butter and chocolate are melted and smooth. It usually takes me 1 minute total.
Whisk in sugars until well-combined. Batter will look grainy.
Whisk in vanilla and eggs, 1 at a time, until combined. Batter should look smooth and be well-combined.
Whisk in cocoa and salt.
Fold in flour until combined. Batter should be thick.
Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in the center comes out with fudgy crumbs.
Let cool to room temperature in pan.
Cover brownies, and chill for at least 3 hours.
