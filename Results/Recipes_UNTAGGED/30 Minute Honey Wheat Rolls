</details>
<ingredients>
1/3 cup butter plus extra for brushing on
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons instant yeast
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 &#188; - 1 &#189; cups whole wheat flour
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 Lightly grease a half sheet pan or a 9x13-inch rimmed cookie sheet.
In a small saucepan, melt butter.
When butter is mostly melted, stir in milk, and heat mixture to 100-110 F.
Meanwhile, add yeast and honey to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl if mixing by hand).
When milk mixture is at temperature, add to yeast and honey; stir to combine.
Add salt and egg, and stir until combined.
Stir in all-purpose flour.
Add 1 cup whole wheat flour, and stir in.
Add remaining whole wheat flour until dough clings to paddle and cleans the sides of the bowl. Dough will still be pretty sticky.
With lightly floured hands, shape dough into 12 rolls, and place dough on prepared baking sheet.
Cover, and let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
