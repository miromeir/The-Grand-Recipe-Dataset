<ingredients>
DOUGH
1 &#189; cups warm water about 105 F
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
3-4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl), stir together the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let stand for 5-10 minutes or until foamy.
Mix in flour and salt until dough clears the sides of the bowl.
Knead dough for three minutes.
Cover, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
Grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet with butter.
Divide dough into 24 pieces.
Shape each piece into a ball, and place dough balls in the prepared skillet.
Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise 20 minutes.
Toward the end of the rising time, preheat oven to 350 F.
Uncover, and bake 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
While bites are baking, stir together granulated sugar and ground cinnamon.
Brush bites with half melted butter.
Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture.
Drizzle remaining half butter over bites.
To make the icing, stir together melted butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla.
Add 1 tablespoon milk, and stir in.
Continue adding milk until icing reaches desired consistency. I use about 1 1/2-2 tablespoons for a thicker icing.
Drizzle icing over bites.
