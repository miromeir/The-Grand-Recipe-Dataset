1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup all-purpose flour

<instructions>
Combine the eggs and milk in the container of a blender. Add the flour, salt and sugar, and blend until smooth.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray or butter. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan to coat the bottom. Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds. Carefully slide a spatula under the pancake and flip. Cook for a few seconds on the other side, just until browned. Remove to a plate, and repeat with remaining batter.
