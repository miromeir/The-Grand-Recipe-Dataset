<ingredients>
8 snow peas
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 pound sirloin steak, thinly sliced
4 potatoes, cut into bite sized pieces
2 cups dashi soup
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup sake

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Put the snow peas in a small saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Drain and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the beef in the oil until browned. Add the potatoes; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the dashi soup, soy sauce, sake, and sugar into the mixture; simmer for 10 minutes.

Reduce heat to low and scatter the chopped onion over the mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid is nearly completely evaporated, about 15 minutes more. Top the mixture with the snow peas to serve.
