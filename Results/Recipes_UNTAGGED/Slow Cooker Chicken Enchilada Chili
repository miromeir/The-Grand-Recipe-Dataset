<ingredients>
10 ounce can red enchilada sauce
14.5 ounce can Hunt's petite diced tomatoes undrained
14.5 ounce can Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes undrained
2-15 ounce cans BUSH'S black beans in mild chili sauce undrained
15 ounces can corn drained
1 1/2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
4 cloves garlic minced
1 teaspoon ancho chili powder**
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika***
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
8 ounces cream cheese**** at room temperature
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Add the enchilada sauce, tomatoes, beans, corn, chicken broth, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, and pepper to a large slow cooker. I use a 6 quart. 
Stir to combine. 
Add the chicken breast, and nestle it into the tomato mixture. 
Cover, and cook on LOW for 6-7 hours. 
Carefully shred chicken using two forks. 
Add cream cheese, and stir in to combine. You may find that you need to let it sit, covered, for a few minutes to let it begin to melt.
