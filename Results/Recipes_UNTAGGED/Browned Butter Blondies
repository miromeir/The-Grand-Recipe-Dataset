<ingredients>
1/2 cup butter
1 &#189; cups light brown sugar packed
1 large egg
1 egg yolk from a large egg
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 &#190; cups all-purpose flour&#185; measured properly

<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour an 8x8-inch baking pan. Set aside.
In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat.
Continue cooking butter until it turns amber brown. Watch carefully as it can burn easily towards the end. 
Add brown sugar, and whisk until combined. Mixture may be crumbly.
Mix in egg and egg yolk.
Add vanilla, and stir until incorporated.
Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt until just combined.
Add chocolate chips and nuts, if using, and stir in.
Pour batter into prepared baking pan.
Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until light golden brown.
Let cool in pan for at least 10 minutes before cutting.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
