<ingredients>
CHOCOLATE CAKE
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Set aside. 
For the cake, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Whisk in the milk, butter, and vanilla.
Stir together until smooth.
Pour the batter into prepared baking pan.
For the topping, whisk together the sugars and cocoa; sprinkle it evenly over the batter.
Pour the hot water over the top. Do not stir the water in.
Bake 25-30 minutes. It should look like a thin layer of baked brownie with fudge bubbling up in spots. 
Take out of the oven, and let stand 15 minutes.
