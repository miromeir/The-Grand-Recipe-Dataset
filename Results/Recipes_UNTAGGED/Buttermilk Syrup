3/4 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup brown sugar packed
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup salted butter
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla
Pinch of salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large, heavy saucepan with high sides, bring buttermilk, sugars, and butter to a boil over medium heat.
Remove from heat and whisk in baking soda and vanilla. It will bubble up a lot, which is why you want to use a large saucepan with high sides.
To serve, let cool to the point that it&#8217;s warm.
