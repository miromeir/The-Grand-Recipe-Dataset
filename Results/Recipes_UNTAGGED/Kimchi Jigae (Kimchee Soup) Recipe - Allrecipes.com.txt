<ingredients>
2 cups chopped kimchi
1 cup water
1 tablespoon brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 pound pork belly, cut into bite-size pieces
1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAMÂ®), cubed (optional)
1/4 cup kochujang (Korean hot sauce) (optional)
1 (12 ounce) package silken tofu
1 (3 ounce) package enoki mushrooms
Add all ingredients to list

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Combine kimchi, water, sugar, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Stir in pork belly, luncheon meat, and kochujang. Add tofu and mushrooms; stir carefully so you don't break up the tofu. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until kimchi is softened and pork is slightly pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes.
