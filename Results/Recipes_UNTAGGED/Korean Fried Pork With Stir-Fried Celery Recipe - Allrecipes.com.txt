<instructions>
Mix 2 tablespoons soy sauce, tomato paste, green onions, rice wine, 1 tablespoon sugar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes in a bowl. Add pork; cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour.

Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pork in batches, being sure not to overcrowd the pan, until slightly pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add celery, remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Saute for 1 minute. Add remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce; cook and stir for 1 minute more. Add celery leaves; cook and stir until celery is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes more. Serve alongside pork.
