<instructions>
Prepare pie crust according to recipe or package directions to the point where it's ready for filling.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
In a large bowl, toss together sliced apple, lemon juice, sugar, and spices.
Toss Greek yogurt and vanilla into apple slices.
Stir in flour.
Add filling to prepared pie crust.
Place on a baking sheet, and bake for 20 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk together flour and sugars for the topping.
Cut in butter to form crumbles.
Top pie with crumbles, and continue to bake for about 20 more minutes, or until topping is lightly browned and apples are hot and bubbly.
If pie crust begins to overbrown, loosely tent with foil.
