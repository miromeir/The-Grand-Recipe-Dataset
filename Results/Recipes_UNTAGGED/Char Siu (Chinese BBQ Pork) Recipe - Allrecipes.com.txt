Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork) Recipe - Allrecipes.com
</title>
<cuisine>
Chinese
</cuisine>
<ingredients>
2 pork tenderloins
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup ketchup
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup Chinese rice wine
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1/2 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (optional)
Add all ingredients to list

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Cut pork with the grain into strips 1 1/2- to 2-inches long; put into a large resealable plastic bag.

Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red food coloring or red bean curd (see Cook's Note), and Chinese five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork, squeeze air from the bag, and seal. Turn bag a few times to coat all pork pieces in marinade.

Marinate pork in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.

Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade.

Cook pork on preheated grill for 20 minutes. Put a small container of water onto the grill and continue cooking, turning the pork regularly, until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
