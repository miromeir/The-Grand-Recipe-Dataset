<ingredients>
MEATBALLS
2 slices fresh white bread*
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter divided
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow or white onion
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pound ground chuck
1/2 pound ground pork
1 large egg yolk
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Tear the bread into pieces and place in a small mixing bowl along with the milk. Set aside.
In a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter.
Add the onion and a pinch of salt, and cook until onions are soft, about 4-5 minutes. 
In a large bowl, combine the bread/milk mixture, ground beef, pork, egg yolks, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, black pepper, allspice, nutmeg, and onions. 
Using a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop, portion out meatballs. 
Heat the remaining tablespoon butter in the now-empty saute pan over medium-low heat.
Working in batches,  add the meatballs and saute until golden brown on all sides, about 7-10 minutes.**
Remove the meatballs to a platter and tent with aluminum foil. 
Once all of the meatballs are cooked, decrease the heat to low, and melt 2 tablespoons butter. 
Add the flour to the pan, and cook until lightly browned, whisking regularly, about 1 minute.  
Gradually add the beef stock and cream, and whisk until sauce begins to thicken. 
Stir in sour cream and dijon mustard and cook until sauce begins to simmer. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Add the meatballs back to the skillet, and simmer for 1-2 minutes. 
Serve over egg noodles topped with fresh parsley, if desired.
