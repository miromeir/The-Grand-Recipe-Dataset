<ingredients>
PASTRY CREAM
2 &#189; c . milk
1 c . granulated sugar
1/2 c . cake flour
1 tsp . kosher salt
8 egg yolks from large eggs
1 T . vanilla extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
FOR THE PASTRY CREAM
Heat milk until hot and bubbly at the edges but not boiling.
While the milk it heating, whisk together sugar, flour, and salt in a small bowl.
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks.
Gradually add the flour mixture to the egg yolks, whisking until incorporated before the next addition.
Stream milk into egg yolk mixture, whisking as you go (otherwise you will end up with scrambled eggs if you add it too quickly or all at once).
Once all of the milk is incorporated, return mixture to saucepan.
Cook, whisking continually, until it bubbles when you stop whisking it, about 4-5 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract.
Place pastry cream in a dish, and cover with plastic wrap. Press plastic wrap to the pastry cream (otherwise you&#8217;ll get a pudding skin on it).
Refrigerate at least 2 hours.
