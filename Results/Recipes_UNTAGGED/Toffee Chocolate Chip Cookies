<ingredients>
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar packed
1 large egg + 1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour*
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt or scant 1/2 teaspoon table salt
1/2 cup toffee bits
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 375 F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
Melt butter in a heavy saucepan.
Add brown sugar to a large bowl.
Pour melted butter over sugar.
Stir to combine butter and sugar. Let stand 5 minutes.
Add egg and egg yolk; stir to combine.
Stir in vanilla extract.
Add flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir until just combined.
Stir in toffee bits and chocolate chips.
I like to chill the dough for at least 30 minutes to give the ingredients a chance to meld. 
Using a medium cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoon), drop scoops of dough 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for about 8-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden brown.
Let cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes. Remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
