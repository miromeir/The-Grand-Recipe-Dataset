<ingredients>
3 cups bread flour
1 1/4 cups boiling water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
Add all ingredients to list

<instructions>
Use a fork to mix flour and boiling water in a large bowl. Knead dough into a ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let dough rest for 30 to 60 minutes.

Evenly divide dough into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/4 inch thick circle. Brush each circle with oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of green onions. Roll up, cigar style; coil each pancake and pinch open ends together to form a disc. Roll each circle flat to about 1/4 inch thickness.

Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet. Fry cakes until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Add more oil between batches, if necessary.
