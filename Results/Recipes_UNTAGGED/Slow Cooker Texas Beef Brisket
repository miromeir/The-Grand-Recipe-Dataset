<ingredients>
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

<instructions>
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, bay leaves, garlic, onion salt, pepper and liquid smoke.
Add brisket to bag.
Seal bag, and refrigerate overnight.
Transfer beef to a slow cooker. I use a 5 quart.
Add broth.
Cover, and cook on low for 8 hours, or until tender.
Remove brisket from the slow cooker.
Discard bay leaves.
Stir together 1 cup beef juices from slow cooker and barbecue sauce.
Discard remaining juices.
Return brisket to the slow cooker, and pour sauce mixture over the top.
Cover, and cook on high for 30 minutes.
Thinly slice beef across the grain. I like to serve the meat on buns and top with the meat with a little bit of extra sauce.
