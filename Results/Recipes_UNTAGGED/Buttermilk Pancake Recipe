2 tablespoons granulated sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups buttermilk low-fat ok
2 large eggs
1/4 cup butter melted

Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk and eggs.
Stir in melted butter and vanilla until combined.
Make a well in center of dry ingredients; pour in wet ingredients, and gently stir until just combined (batter may still be a bit lumpy). Do not overmix.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Grease the skillet using butter, oil, or nonstick cooking spray.
Using 1/4 cup measuring cup, portion batter into pan in 4 places.
Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2-3 minutes.
Flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1-2 minutes longer.
