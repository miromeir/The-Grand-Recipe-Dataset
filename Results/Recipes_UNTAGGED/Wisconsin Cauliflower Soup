In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat.
Add onion, and cook until soft, about 3-5 minutes.
Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, for about 30 seconds.
Pour in chicken broth.
Add cauliflower, and cover skillet (I just use a piece of foil).
Let the cauliflower steam until fork-tender, about 10 minutes.
Carefully add cauliflower and broth mixture to a blender.
Add in fat-free half-and-half and dry mustard.
Blend until smooth.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Stir in shredded cheese, and let melt.
Garnish with a pinch of shredded cheddar or Parmesan cheese, if desired.
