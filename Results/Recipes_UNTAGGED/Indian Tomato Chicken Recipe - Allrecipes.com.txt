<ingredients>
1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 slice fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
6 skinless chicken thighs
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed
Add all ingredients to list

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Place onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor and process into a paste. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add onion paste and saute, stirring continuously, for about 10 minutes.

Stir in the cumin, turmeric, salt, pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves and nutmeg. Saute, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Place chicken pieces in skillet and stir them around with the spice mixture until they are well coated.

Saute for another 4 minutes, then pour in the tomatoes with liquid and stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 to 2 hours, or until the oil has separated from the liquid. Stir occasionally. (Note: If you simmer uncovered, the sauce will thicken; add water, or keep covered while simmering.)
