Tortillas II Recipe - Allrecipes.com
</title>
<cuisine>
Latin American
</cuisine>
<ingredients>
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon shortening
1/2 cup water
Add all ingredients to list

</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large mixing bowl, combine together flour, salt and baking powder. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.

Add the water and mix until the dough can be gathered together. If necessary, add more water (1 teaspoon at a time) until the dough comes together. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes.

Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll into rounds. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to flatten and stretch each round into a circle 7 inches across.

Cook on an ungreased skillet over medium high heat until brown spots begin to appear on the tortillas. Keep covered with a clean, dry towel until ready to serve.
