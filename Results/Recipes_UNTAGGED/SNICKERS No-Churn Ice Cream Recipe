<ingredients>
14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
15 bite-sized SNICKERS candy bars chopped, divided
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons chopped peanuts optional
1-2 tablespoons caramel sauce optional
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Place a 6-cup container into the freezer. I've used a 9x5-inch loaf pan and an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Either one works well.
In a large bowl, stir sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and chopped SNICKERS bars together. I reserve 1-2 chopped bars to sprinkle over the top. This is optional. Set aside.
In a separate large bowl, beat the whipping cream to stiff peaks.
Fold 1 cup of the whipped cream into the sweetened condensed milk mixture.
Fold in remaining whipped cream.
Remove container from the freezer, and pour the mixture into the container.
OPTIONAL: Sprinkle remaining chopped SNICKERS bars and chopped nuts over the top. Drizzle with caramel. 
Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 6-8 hours, or until firm.
