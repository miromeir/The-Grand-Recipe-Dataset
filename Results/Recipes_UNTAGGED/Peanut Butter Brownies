<ingredients>
BROWNIES
1 cup butter melted
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups granulated sugar
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips*
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat butter, eggs, and vanilla together until smooth.
Whisk the dry ingredients together in a separate medium bowl.
Gradually add flour mixture to egg mixture, and stir until just incorporated.
Stir in chocolate chips.
Remove 1 cup brownie batter for topping, and set aside.
Spread remaining batter into prepared baking pan.
In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth.
Add the peanut butter and sugar, and beat together until smooth.
Beat in egg and milk on low just until combined.
Carefully spread peanut butter mixture over brownie batter.
Drop reserved batter by tablespoonfuls over filling.
Cut through batter with a knife to swirl. You won't want to overdo the swirling or you'll end up without distinct swirls.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few fudgy crumbs.
Let come to room temperature before serving.
Cover and chill leftovers.
