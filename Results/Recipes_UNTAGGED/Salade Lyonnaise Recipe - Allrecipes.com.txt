<ingredients>
1 cup chopped smoked bacon
4 eggs
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 cups curly endive, chopped
2 roma tomatoes, sliced
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon white sugar
2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
salt and pepper to taste
1 small onion, finely chopped

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.

Meanwhile, fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in the vinegar, and keep the water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slip the egg into the simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of the water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Poach the eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, then place onto a warm plate.

Divide the romaine lettuce evenly over four plates, and sprinkle with garlic. Top each salad with tomatoes, onion, bacon, and a poached egg.

Whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, herbes de Provence, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Spoon the dressing over the salad, or serve on the side.
