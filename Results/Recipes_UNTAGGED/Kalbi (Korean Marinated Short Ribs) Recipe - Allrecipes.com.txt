Place ribs in a bowl and cover with water; soak until water turns pink, about 1 hour. Drain and rinse in cold water.

Combine soy sauce, Asian pear, onion, garlic, and ginger in a food processor. Pulse until smooth.

Combine green onions, sesame oil, brown sugar, sesame seeds, honey, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Add ribs and coat thoroughly with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.

Cook ribs on the grill until slightly charred and tender, about 4 minutes per side.
