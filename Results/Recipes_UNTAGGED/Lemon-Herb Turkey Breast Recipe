<ingredients>
6-7 pound bone-in turkey breast
1 tablespoon minced garlic about 3 cloves
2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 cup chicken broth
1 lemon quartered
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 325 F.
Place the turkey breast, skin side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. I spray the roasting pan rack with nonstick cooking spray.
Stir together garlic, mustard, chopped herbs, salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon juice until combined.
Gently pull back the skin from the meat and rub about 1/2-2/3 of the mixture directly on the meat. Spread the rest of the mixture evenly on the skin.
Pour the chicken broth into the bottom of the roasting pan, and place the quartered lemon into the cavity.
Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, or until the skin is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 F when inserted into the thickest and meatiest areas of the breast.
If the skin starts to get too dark, tent some aluminum foil over it.
Remove from the oven, and let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
