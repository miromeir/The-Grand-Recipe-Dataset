1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground oregano

1/2 cup warm water
1 bag of Fritos
grated sharp cheddar cheese sour cream, lettuce, or any other desired toppings
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Brown ground beef in a pot over medium-high heat.
Drain ground beef, and add garlic to ground beef. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
CROCK POT: Add browned ground beef to 5 qt or larger crockpot with tomato sauce, Rotel, salt, oregano, cumin, chili powder, Tabasco, and beans. Stir to combine.
Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours before serving stir.
Add in cornmeal and water, if necessary.
Cover, and cook an additional 30-60 minutes.
STOVE TOP: Add tomato sauce, Rotel, salt, oregano, cumin, chili powder, Tabasco, and beans to the browned ground beef. Stir to combine.
Cover and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for at least 1 hour.
Mix corn meal with water, and then add to the chili. Stir to combine and simmer for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
I like to top my chili with the Fritos so that they stay crunchy, but you can top Fritos with chili. Add any other desired toppings, and enjoy!
