<ingredients>
1 serving cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) package tofu
2 tablespoons Japanese low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons Asian chili sauce
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
Add all ingredients to list

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Lay the tofu on a plate lined with a couple sheets of paper towel. Layer more paper towel atop tofu and place another plate atop the stack to press water from the tofu. Let sit at least 5 minutes.

Cut tofu into 1/2-inch strips and put into a large, sealable plastic bag; add soy sauce, chili sauce, ginger, and hoisin sauce. Squeeze bag to remove excess air and seal. Marinate tofu in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.

Remove tofu from the marinade, shake to remove excess moisture, and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. Discard the remaining marinade.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, flip, and continue baking until firm, 15 to 20 minutes more.
