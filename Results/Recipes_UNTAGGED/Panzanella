SALAD
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 small loaf French bread crust removed, cut into 1-inch cubes (3 cups)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup cherry tomatoes halved
1 cucumber peeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick
1 red bell pepper seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 yellow bell pepper seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes
5 large basil leaves coarsely chopped

Heat the oil in a large saute pan. Add the bread and salt; cook over low to medium heat, tossing frequently, for 10 minutes, or until nicely browned. Add more oil as needed.
For the vinaigrette, whisk all the ingredients together. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix the tomatoes, cucumber, red pepper, mozzarella cheese, and basil. Add the bread cubes and toss with the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper. Allow the salad to sit for about half an hour for the flavors to blend.
