<ingredients>
3 cups cake flour&#185;
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 &#189; cups plain, non-fat Greek yogurt&#178;
1/2 cup butter softened
3 cups granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease and flour (or spray with a nonstick spray like Baker&#8217;s Joy that has flour in it) a 12-cup bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat yogurt, butter, and sugar together until well-combined.
Beat in eggs one at a time.
Stir in extracts.
Add flour mixture, and stir in until just combined.
Pour batter into prepared bundt pan.
Bake 60-80 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. You may need to cover the exposed cake with foil if it starts to brown too much.
Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
