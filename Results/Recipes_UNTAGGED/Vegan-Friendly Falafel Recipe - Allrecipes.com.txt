<ingredients>
1 pound dry garbanzo beans
1 onion, quartered
1 potato, peeled and quartered
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup cilantro leaves, chopped
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

2 cups canola oil

<instructions>
Rinse the garbanzo beans under cold water and discard any bad ones. Place in a large pot, and cover with water. Let soak 24 hours, and rinse again.

Place the garbanzo beans, onion, and potato in the bowl of a food processor. Cover, and process until finely chopped. Leaving about 1 cup of the garbanzo bean mixture in the food processor bowl, pour the rest into a mixing bowl. Add the garlic, cilantro, coriander, cumin, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to the garbanzo bean mixture in the food processor bowl; process on low to blend thoroughly. Return the reserved garbanzo bean mixture to the food processor bowl, and add the lemon juice, olive oil, and flour; process on low into a coarse meal. Cover, and refrigerate 2 hours.

Stir the baking soda into the garbanzo bean mixture until evenly blended. Using damp hands, form the mixture into 1 1/2 inch diameter balls.

Pour the canola oil into a wok 1 to 2 inches deep, and heat over medium-high heat. Cook the falafel balls, turning so all sides are evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove falafel from oil, and drain on paper towels. Repeat to cook remaining falafel balls.
