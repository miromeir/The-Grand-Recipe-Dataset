<ingredients>
BROWNIE
1 cup + 2 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4 large eggs
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Set aside.
In a saucepan, melt butter.
Remove from the heat. Stir in cocoa. Set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until blended.
Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to egg mixture.
Stir in vanilla and the cooled chocolate mixture until well blended.
Spread into prepared baking pan.
To make the topping, melt butter over medium-low heat in a large saucepan.
Stir in flour until smooth.
Stir in brown sugar, corn syrup, and 2 eggs until well-combined.
Increase heat to medium; cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until mixture just begins to boil.
Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla and pecans.
Spoon topping over brownie batter.
Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick comes out with just a few fudgy crumbs.
Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.
I store the leftover brownies in the fridge with the cut portion covered.
