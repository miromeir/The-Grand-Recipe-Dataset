</details>
<ingredients>
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 &#190; teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 &#189; cups lukewarm water
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and yeast.
Add water and mix until a shaggy mixture forms.
Cover bowl with greased plastic wrap and set aside for 12 - 18 hours. Making it the night before works really well.
Heat oven to 450 F.
When the oven has reached 450 F, place a Dutch oven or Corningware in the oven and heat the pot for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour dough onto a very heavily floured, movable surface (cheesecloth, cutting board). With floured hands, shape dough into a ball.
Cover with greased plastic wrap and let it sit while the pot is heating.
Remove hot pot from the oven, drop in the dough, and cover. If you're using Corningware, simply cover with foil.
Return to oven for 30 minutes.
For a crispier loaf, uncover, and continue baking for 5-10 additional minutes. 
Remove bread from oven and place on a cooling rack to cool.
For softer bread, let bread cool for 5 minutes on a rack. Then, place in a plastic bag but do not seal.
For crustier bread, let cool to room temperature on rack.
