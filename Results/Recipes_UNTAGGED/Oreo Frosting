</details>
<ingredients>
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 &#189; cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 &#189; cups salted butter at cool room temperature
1 &#189; cups granulated sugar
Pinch of salt
10 OREO cookies cookie and filling crushed to fine crumbs**
</ingredients>
<instructions>
In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will be the consistency of a thick paste.*
Remove from heat, and let it cool to room temperature. This step is key. If the milk mixture is at all warm, it won't come together properly.
Stir in vanilla.
Once the mixture is cool, cream the butter, sugar, and salt together until light and fluffy on medium-high, about 5 minutes.
Then add the completely cooled milk mixture.
Beat it for about 5 minutes on medium-high to high until it looks like whipped cream. It may look separated at first, so keep beating it until it comes together and looks like whipped cream.
Fold in cookie crumbs.
Frost cake or cupcakes of your choice.
