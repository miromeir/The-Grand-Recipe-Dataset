<instructions>
Mix rice wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger, salt, and 1 pinch pepper in a bowl with the chicken. Allow to sit for 20 to 30 minutes.

Combine honey, vinegar, brown sugar, gochujang, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger, and 1 pinch black pepper in a pot over medium heat. Stir well; when bubbling, reduce heat to low and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.

Toss cornstarch with the chicken to coat evenly.

Fill a pan with 1 inch oil and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add chicken in small batches, making sure to not overcrowd the pan. Cook until lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.

Reheat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and deep fry chicken once more until deeply golden, about 40 seconds each. Transfer chicken to the pot of sauce.

Heat sauce and chicken over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 3 minutes.
