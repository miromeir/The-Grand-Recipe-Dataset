<ingredients>
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup lard
2 cups buttermilk

<instructions>
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

Whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, and baking powder. Cut lard into flour mixture using a pastry blender until crumbly; stir in buttermilk. Turn mixture onto a floured surface and knead just a few times to form a moist dough.

Roll dough out 1-inch thick; cut biscuits with a cookie cutter or round glass. Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet.

Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden, about 12 minutes.
