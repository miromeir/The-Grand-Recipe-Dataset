<instructions>
Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add potatoes; stir-fry until browned in spots and partially cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.

While potatoes are cooking, mix water, soy sauce, ketchup, corn syrup, sugar, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl.

Pour soy sauce mixture over potatoes. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender and sauce thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and toss to coat.
