<ingredients>
1 &#189; cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature
3/4 cup brown sugar packed
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar
2 large egg yolks
1 large egg
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate coarsely chopped

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat oven to 375&#176; F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, kosher salt, and baking soda; set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, stir together butter, brown sugar, sugar, and powdered sugar on low for 30 seconds.
Turn mixer up to medium and beat until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes.
Add egg yolks, egg, and vanilla. Beat, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until mixture is pale and fluffy, 4-5 minutes.
Reduce mixer speed to low; slowly add dry ingredients, mixing just to blend.
Stir in chocolate by hand.
Spoon a small cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop scoops of cookie dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 1-inch apart.
Sprinkle cookies lightly with sea salt.
Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until just golden brown around the edges, 8-10 minutes (the cookies will firm up as they cool).
Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks; let cool completely.
