<ingredients>
1/2 cup butter

4 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup +2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan, and line with parchment paper. Set aside.
Melt butter and chocolate chips in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently, until melted. Remove from heat, and set aside.
In a separate bowl, beat cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar together until smooth.
Beat in egg and 2 tablespoons flour. Set aside. 
In a separate large bowl, beat remaining sugar and eggs together until smooth and well-combined.
Add vanilla and chocolate mixture, and mix until well-combined.
Stir in remaining flour and salt until combined.
Spread 3/4 of brownie mixture into prepared pan. 
Pour the cream cheese mixture over brownie layer, and spread evenly. 
Top with remaining brownie batter, and gently spread to cover cream cheese mixture.
Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick comes out with just fudgy crumbs.
Cool on a wire rack for 1 1/2 hours. 
Freeze for at least 45 minutes, and cut just before serving.
