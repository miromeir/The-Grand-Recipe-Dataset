<ingredients>
3-4 pounds boneless pork shoulder
1 T . olive oil
1/2 T . ground cumin
1/2 T . dried oregano
1/2 T . fresh ground pepper
1 tsp . kosher salt
4 cloves garlic , minced
2 T . fresh-squeezed lime juice (about 1 large lime&#8217;s worth)
1 c . orange juice
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Drizzle the olive oil in the slow cooker bowl.
Place untrimmed pork, fat side down in the bowl. Then turn it so the fat side is up. This coats both sides with olive oil.
Sprinkle the roast with salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano.
Spoon the garlic over the roast.
Pour the lime juice and orange juice around the edges of the roast.
Cover, and cook on low for 8-10 hours, or until meat falls apart when shredded with a fork.
