6 cloves garlic minced
1-2 tablespoons ancho chile powder depending on desired heat
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon dried oregano
5 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

<instructions>
Add onions, bell pepper, garlic, chile powder, cumin, and oregano to slow cooker. I use a 5 quart.
Stir in chicken broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, Tabasco sauce, and liquid smoke.
Add beans and bay leaves; stir to combine.
Cover, and cook on LOW for 9-11 hours or on HIGH for 5-7 hours.
Stir in kielbasa, and let cook until heated through, about 20-30 minutes.
Remove at least 1 cup of beans, and mash until smooth. Can mash more for a creamier soup.
Return mashed beans to slow cooker, and stir in.
Remove bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper.
