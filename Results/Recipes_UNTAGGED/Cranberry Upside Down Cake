TOPPING
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar packed
2 cups fresh cranberries
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat an oven to 350 F.
Put butter in 9-inch round cake pan, and place it in the oven while the oven preheats. Leave it in there until it melts (keep an eye on it, though).
Once butter has melted, sprinkle brown sugar evenly over the pan.
Arrange cranberries in an even layer over the brown sugar. Set aside.
To make the cake, in a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In another bowl, using an electric mixer (either hand or stand), beat together the butter and granulated sugar on until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add the vanilla and buttermilk; mix well.
Add the flour mixture, and stir until just incorporated.
In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.
Add the cream of tartar, and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.
Gently fold the whites into the batter.
Carefully pour the batter over the cranberries in the cake pan.
Bake 45-55 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Let the cake cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes.
Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake.
Invert onto a serving plate, let stand for 5 minutes, and then lift off the pan.
