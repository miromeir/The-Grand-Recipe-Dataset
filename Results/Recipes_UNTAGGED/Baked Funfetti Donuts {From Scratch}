<ingredients>
DONUTS
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons warm water about 100 F
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 &#188; cups granulated sugar
1 &#189; teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon . fine sea salt or a pinch of table salt
2 large eggs
3/4 cup vanilla Greek yogurt fat-free is ok
1/4 cup butter melted
1/4 cup low-fat milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup sprinkles
</ingredients>
<instructions>
To make the donuts, preheat oven to 350 F. Spray two (6-count) doughnut pans with a flour-based baking spray, like Baker's Joy.
In a small bowl, stir water and yeast together. Let the yeast sit for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
Add the eggs, yogurt, butter, milk, vanilla, and yeast mixture; stir until combined.
Gently stir in sprinkles until just incorporated. Do not over-stir as sprinkles can bleed. 
Spoon batter (about 1/4-cup per donut) into prepared pans, smoothing as needed.
Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until set and light golden brown.
Let the donuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the glaze.
In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla to form a thick but viscous glaze.
Remove donuts to wire rack, and drizzle warm donuts with glaze.
Add sprinkles while glaze is still warm. Once the glaze sets up, the sprinkles won't stick.
Donuts are best enjoyed warm.
