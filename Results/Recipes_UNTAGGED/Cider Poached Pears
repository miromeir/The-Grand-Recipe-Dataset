<ingredients>
4 ripe Green Anjou pears*
2 cups apple cider
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Peel pears, and slice in half lengthwise.
Leave the stems but remove the core.
In a large, shallow skillet, bring apple cider and spices just to boil over medium heat.
Add pears.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer pears until tender, about 20-25 minutes. I flip my pears over half way through.
Serve pears warm with cider spooned over the top.
