<ingredients>
2 heads bok choy, cut into 2-inch squares
1/2 cup pickling salt, divided, or more to taste
1/4 cup Korean chile powder
6 green onions, chopped
4 large carrots, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
3 serrano chile peppers, thinly sliced, or more to taste (optional)
4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
2 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger, or more to taste
Add all ingredients to list

</ingredients>
<instructions>
Place bok choy in a large bowl; add 1/4 cup pickling salt and stir; cover with an upside-down plate. Let salted cabbage sit until softened and liquid has been released, 2 to 3 days. Rinse cabbage in a colander and drain.

Transfer cabbage to a clean bowl; add 1/4 cup pickling salt, Korean chile powder, green onions, carrots, serrano chile peppers, garlic, fish sauce, and ginger and mix well.

Pack cabbage mixture into clean jars to within 1 inch of the top. Tightly secure lids onto each jar.

Refrigerate until flavors have had time to merge and cabbage has fermented, at least 2 weeks.
