<ingredients>
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 large eggs separated
2 tablespoons butter at room temperature
1 cup skim milk
5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
Powdered sugar optional
</ingredients>
<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease six 6-ounce ramekins with vegetable oil spray.
In a medium bowl, whisk sugar and flour together; set aside.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and butter until well blended.
Whisk in the milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
Pour the lemon mixture into the sugar mixture, and whisk until well combined.
In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until firm peaks form.
Gently fold the egg whites into the lemon mixture.
Divide the batter between the prepared ramekins, and transfer them to a small roasting pan.
Place the pan in the oven, and pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
Bake for 35 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden on top.
Transfer the ramekins to a rack to cool for 20 minutes.
Dust the tops with powdered sugar, if using, and enjoy!
