<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and cocoa powder together.
Melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler, stirring until smooth and well-combined.
Add the sugars to the chocolate mixture, and whisk until well-combined.
Cook, whisking constantly, for 2-3 minutes, to let the sugars combine with the butter/chocolate mixture.
Remove the chocolate mixture from heat, and let it cool to room temperature.
Once the chocolate mixture has reached room temperature, whisk in eggs one at a time until combined.
Add the vanilla and stir until combined.
Whisk in the flour mixture until just combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few fudgy crumbs.
Let the brownies cool in the pan to room temperature.
At this point, serve brownies, or wrap in plastic wrap (in the pan) and chill for a more fudge-like brownie.
