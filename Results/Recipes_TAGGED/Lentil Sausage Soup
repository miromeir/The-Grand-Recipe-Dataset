<instructions>
Rinse the lentils; put them in a large saucepan with about 3 cups of water and the bay leaves.
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large Dutch oven. I used a 5 quart, and it was just over half full.
Add the sausage and brown, stirring frequently.
Remove the sausage to a cutting board and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. 
Return sausage slices to the pan, and brown sides. 
Remove sausage to plate.
Add the onions and garlic to the now-empty pot, and season with salt. 
Cook onions and garlic over medium heat, stirring regularly, until the onions have softened.
Stir in the celery and herbs de provence.
Add the wine, and let it cook down until reduced by half.
Stir in the lentils with their cooking water, broth, sliced sausage, and carrots.
Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat. 
Simmer until the lentils are tender about, 30-45 minutes.
Stir in spinach and parsley, and simmer for five minutes.
Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
