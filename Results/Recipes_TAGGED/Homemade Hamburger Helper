<instructions>
Heat a Dutch oven or large deep skillet over medium-high heat.
Add beef, and cook until browned. 
Drain ground beef, and return to skillet. 
Stir in onion, and, stirring regularly, cook until just softened, about 3 minutes. 
Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT cheese, and stir to combine.
Bring to simmer, and reduce heat to medium-low. You want the mixture to simmer gently, not boil. 
Cook for about 10 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed but mixture is still saucy. At this point, the pasta should be al dente. 
Stir in cheese. 
Sprinkle with additional cheese, if desired. 
Remove from heat, and serve.
