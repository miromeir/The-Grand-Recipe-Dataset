<instructions>
Preheat oven to 325 F. Place baking rack in the lower third of oven.
Rinse ham in cold water, and pat dry.
Place fat side up in a shallow baking dish.
Bake ham for half the baking time (75 minutes).
Stir maple syrup, brown sugar, mustard, and vinegar together.
Brush ham with maple syrup mixture. 
Baste ham with juices regularly throughout remaining baking time. If ham begins to caramelize too much, tent loosely with foil.
Let ham continue to bake until it reaches a temperature of 140 F.
Let ham rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving.
