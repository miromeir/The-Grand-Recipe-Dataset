<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Cook pasta to almost al dente (about 1 minute less than the package calls for).
Remove pasta, reserving boiling water.
Add spinach to boiling water, and let cook for 30 seconds.
Remove spinach with a slotted spoon, and place in cold water.
Squeeze moisture out of spinach; set aside.
Meanwhile in a large pot, melt butter; whisk in flour until smooth.
Whisk in milk and ranch seasoning.
Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
Reduce heat to low; fold in Greek yogurt until blended.
Remove sauce from heat.
Stir in 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese until melted and combined.
Add chicken, bacon, cooked pasta, and cooked spinach; toss to coat in cheese sauce.
Pour pasta mixture into a casserole dish.
Top with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese.
Bake until hot and bubbly, about 20-25 minutes.
Serve sprinkled with additional Parmesan if desired.
