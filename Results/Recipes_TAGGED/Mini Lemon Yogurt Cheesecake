<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
In a medium bowl, beat together cream cheese, yogurt, sugar, egg, lemon juice, vanilla, and lemon zest until well-combined.
Mix in flour until incorporated.
Place one vanilla wafer in the bottom of each liner, flat side down.
Divide batter equally among the muffin cups. They will be about 2/3 full.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until set.
Remove from oven, and let the cheesecakes come to about room temperature.
Remove from tin, and chill for about 3 hours before serving.
