Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Heat oil in frying pan over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes per side until well-browned.

Stir jam, salad dressing, onion soup mix, and garlic together in a bowl until well-blended. Place chops in a 9x13 inch baking pan lined with foil, and cover with apricot mixture.

Bake in preheated oven approximately 40 minutes, until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), or pork is no longer pink in the center.
