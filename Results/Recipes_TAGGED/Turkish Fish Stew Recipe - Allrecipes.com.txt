<instructions>
In a medium saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil, and stir in the couscous. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 5 minutes.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion and green pepper about 5 minutes, until tender. Mix in the garlic, and continue to cook and stir about 2 minutes. Mix in the artichoke hearts with reserved liquid, capers with reserved liquid, and olives. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, lemon juice, and 1 cup water (or enough to attain desired thickness). Season with sumac powder, red pepper, basil, cumin, ginger, and pepper.

Bring the mixture to a boil, and mix in the fish chunks. Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, or until the fish is easily flaked with a fork. Serve over couscous.
