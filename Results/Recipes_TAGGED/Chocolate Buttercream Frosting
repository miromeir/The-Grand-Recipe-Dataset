With an electric mixer (either hand or stand), beat butter until pale, about 3-4 minutes on medium.
Scrape down the bowl.
Add 3&#189; cups powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of milk.
Mix on low until powdered sugar and cocoa powder are incorporated.
If the frosting is too dry, add another tablespoon of milk. If the frosting is too wet, add powdered sugar 2 tablespoons at a time until it reaches a spreadable consistency.
