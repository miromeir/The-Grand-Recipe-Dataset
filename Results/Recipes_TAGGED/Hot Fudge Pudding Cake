Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Set aside. 
For the cake, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Whisk in the milk, butter, and vanilla.
Stir together until smooth.
Pour the batter into prepared baking pan.
For the topping, whisk together the sugars and cocoa; sprinkle it evenly over the batter.
Pour the hot water over the top. Do not stir the water in.
Bake 25-30 minutes. It should look like a thin layer of baked brownie with fudge bubbling up in spots. 
Take out of the oven, and let stand 15 minutes.
