<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a shallow baking dish; set aside.
In a skillet, brown sausage. Try to break the pieces up; you don't want any giant pieces of sausage in the dip.
Drain, and return to pan.
Add onion and garlic; saute for 30 seconds, stirring the entire time.
Add tomatoes, basil, and salt to taste.
Let simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
While the sauce simmers, stir together ricotta, egg, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
Spread cheese mixture into the bottom of prepared baking dish.
Top with tomato sauce, and then sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and Italian cheese.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
This dip is especially good when served with garlic knots
