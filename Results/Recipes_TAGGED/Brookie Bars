<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish. Set aside.
To make the cookie layer, beat butter and sugars together until well-combined.
Add egg and vanilla. Mix until incorporated.
Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt until just combined.
Drop dollops of dough in bottom of prepared pan, and gently smooth with a spatula until dough covers bottom of pan.
Sprinkle chocolate chips over dough, and gently press into dough.
Bake cookie layer for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the brownie layer.
Whisk melted butter and sugars together until well-combined.
Stir in eggs and vanilla extract until incorporated.
Add cocoa powder, flour, and baking powder. Stir until just combined.
Remove pan from oven, and gently pour brownie batter over cookie dough.
Gently spread to cover, if necessary. It's ok if dough swirls a little.
Continue baking for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool completely in pan before cutting into bars.
