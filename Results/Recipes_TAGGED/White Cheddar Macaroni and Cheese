<instructions>
In a large saucepan, whisk milk and flour together.
Heat milk mixture over medium-low heat, whisking regularly, until thickened. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes for me.
Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions. Set aside. 
Once milk has thickened, remove from heat.
Stir in dry mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and cubes of cheese.
Continue stirring until cheese has melted.
Toss cheese sauce and cooked pasta together, and serve.
