<instructions>
In a large pot, bring chicken stock to a boil.
Add orzo, and cook until al dente.
While the orzo is cooking, whisk together lemon juice and eggs.
When orzo is al dente, ladle out 1 cup of the chicken broth.
Slowly add about 1 tablespoon of broth at a time to the egg mixture, whisking constantly.
Once the broth has been whisked into the egg mixture, slowly stream the egg mixture back into the pot of broth, whisking constantly.
Add the shredded chicken broth, and simmer until soup has thickened, whisking constantly, about 3-5 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
