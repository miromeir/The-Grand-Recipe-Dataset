<instructions>
Boil pasta according to package directions.
Meanwhile, heat a deep 12-inch broiler-safe skillet over medium heat.
Cook sausage or ground beef, stirring to break up, until heated through but not browned. Drain fat and return to pan.
Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic to skillet. 
Season with salt and pepper.
Cover, and cook over medium heat until veggies are soft, about 4 minutes.
Stir in half pepperoni, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and seasonings.
Simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.
Stir cooked pasta into sauce along with 1 cup mozzarella cheese; toss to combine.
Top with remaining half pepperoni and half mozzarella cheese.
Broil 1-2 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
