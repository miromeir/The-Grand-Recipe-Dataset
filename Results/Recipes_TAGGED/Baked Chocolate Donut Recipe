<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 2 standard sized donut pans (12 donuts total); set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Add egg, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined. Batter will be on the thinner side.
Spoon batter into a donut pan, filling about 3/4 full.
Bake for about 8-10 minutes. Donuts should spring back when lightly touched.
Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes.
Remove from pan, and set on wire cooling rack.
Once donuts are cool, prepare glaze.
In a heavy saucepan over lowest heat, melt butter half-way.
Add chocolate chips and corn syrup. Stir regularly until completely melted and well-incorporated.
Once glaze is ready, dip the tops of the donuts into the glaze.
Set on a wire cooling rack, and let glaze set up, if desired.
