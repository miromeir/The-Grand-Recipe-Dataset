<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Line 2-12 cup muffin tins with liners.
In large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Whisk in oil and buttermilk until combined.
Add eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition.
Whisk in vanilla extract.
Add hot water, and whisk in until well-combined. Batter will be thin.
Divide batter among muffin tins.
Bake 18-25 minutes, or until done. 
Let cupcakes cool in pan for 10 minutes, and then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
Once the cupcakes are completely cool, prepare the icing.
For the icing, combine the butter, cocoa, and buttermilk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Remove from heat, and add the powdered sugar, and vanilla.
Let icing set up for about 5 minutes before swirling tops of cupcakes into icing.
Sprinkle nuts on top of icing, if using.
