<instructions>
Add sliced onion to the bottom of slow cooker. I use a 5 quart oval slow cooker.
Place chicken over sliced onions.
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. I use about 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.
Add all of the sauce ingredients to a blender, and blend until well-combined. 
Cover, and chill half of sauce. 
Pour remaining half sauce over chicken.
Cover, and cook on LOW for 6-7 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours.
Shred meat, and return to slow cooker.
Add remaining half sauce.
Turn slow cooker to WARM, and let sit in sauce until warmed through.
