<instructions>
In a large bowl, stir together milk, yeast, and maple syrup. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.
Stir in remaining ingredients until combined.
Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes; the mixture will begin to bubble.
Preheat your waffle iron.
Spray iron with non-stick cooking spray, and pour 2/3 to 3/4 cup batter (or the amount recommended by the manufacturer) onto the center of the iron.
Close the lid, and bake for the recommended amount of time, or until the waffle is golden brown.
Serve immediately, or keep warm in a 200 F oven.
Yield - 4 large (4-square) waffles
