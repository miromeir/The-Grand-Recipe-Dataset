<instructions>
In a small saucepan melt butter over low heat; cool slightly.
Transfer melted butter to a large mixing bowl.
Add brown sugar and granulated sugar, and beat on medium speed about 2 minutes or until well-combined.
In a small bowl whisk together the egg, egg yolk, milk, and vanilla.
Add to butter mixture, and beat on low speed just until combined.
Beat in flour and salt just until combined.
Stir in chocolate chunks and pistachio nuts.
Cover and chill dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or with a silicone baking mat.
Using a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop (medium), scoop mounds of dough. 
Rolls each scoop of dough in remaining sugar, and place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until edges are light brown. The centers may still look underdone.
