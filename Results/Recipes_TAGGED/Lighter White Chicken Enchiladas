Add onion, and cook for 2-3 minutes.

In a separate saucepan, melt butter.
Whisk in flour, and cook for 1 minute.

Whisk in 1 &#189; cups shredded cheese until melted.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
To assemble, spoon chicken mixture down center of each tortilla.
Roll tortillas up, and place seam side down in prepared baking dish.
Pour cheese mixture all over the top of the enchiladas.
