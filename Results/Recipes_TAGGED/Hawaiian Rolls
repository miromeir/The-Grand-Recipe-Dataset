<instructions>
In a small saucepan, heat pineapple juice over medium-low temperature until juice reaches about 105 F.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, stir together yeast and 2 tablespoons of sugar.
Once the pineapple juice is at temperature, add to the bowl. Stir, and let the yeast mixture stand for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.
Once the yeast is foamy, add the remaining sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and eggs; stir to combine.
Switch from the paddle attachment to the dough hook, and add 3 cups of flour and salt. Stir on low.
Continue adding flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough clears the sides of the bowl. The dough will feel slightly sticky. It takes 5 1/2 cups of flour for my rolls.
Once the dough comes together and clears the sides, continue to knead for about 1 minute.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let it rise until dough has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
Shape dough into rolls. If you would like smaller, dinner-sized rolls, shape into 24 rolls. If you would like larger, bun-sized rolls, shape into 12-18 rolls depending on desired size.
Cover rolls with plastic wrap, and let rolls rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.
Toward the end of the second rise, preheat oven to 350 F.
Bake rolls for about 20 minutes (for dinner-sized rolls), or until rolls are golden brown.
Immediately brush rolls with butter.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
