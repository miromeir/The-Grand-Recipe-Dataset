BROWNIE COOKIE DOUGH
Melt chocolate and butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until melted and well-combined.
Remove from heat, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs, sugars, vanilla, baking powder, and salt on high speed 5 minutes, or until the batter is thick and creamy.
Reduce the speed to low, and mix in the melted chocolate until well-combined.
Stir in flour and cocoa powder just until combined.
Add chocolate chips. Stir in to combine.
Cover the batter, and chill while you prepare the chocolate chip cookie dough.
