Add eggs and vanilla, and mix in until combined.
Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt until just combined.
Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Stir together sugar and cinnamon in a small, shallow dish.
Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop out balls of cookie dough.
Roll into balls, and then roll in cinnamon/sugar.
Place on cookie sheet, and barely flatten cookies.
Bake for 8-9 minutes. Cookies will be set but still look wet between the cracks.
Let cool on baking sheet.
