<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan. I like to use a nonstick baking spray with flour.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together sugar and butter until creamy and well-combined.
Add eggs and vanilla; beat until combined.
Alternate stirring in the flour mixture in three additions with the milk in two additions.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Do not overbake. Cake should be flat and light in color.
Let cool completely in pan.
To make the topping, dice up strawberries. Set aside.
Spread thawed whipped topping evenly over cooled cake.
Top with diced strawberries.
Refrigerate for 3 hours before serving.
