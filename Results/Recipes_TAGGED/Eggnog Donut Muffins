Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease 36 mini muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Set aside.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together eggnog, yogurt, sugar, and vegetable oil until well-combined.
Whisk in egg, vanilla, and rum.
Add flour mixture, and whisk in until just combined.
Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until muffins spring back when lightly touched.
Meanwhile, stir together granulated sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
When the muffins have finished baking, let sit in pan for 5 minutes.
