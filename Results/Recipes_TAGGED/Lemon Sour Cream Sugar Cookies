Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.

In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugars until well-combined.
Beat in egg yolks one at a time, scraping down the sides as necessary.

Add dry ingredients, and mix until just combined.
Scoop dough using a medium cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoons), and drop onto prepared baking sheets, spacing cookies 2-inches apart.
Bake for 10-13 minutes.
Let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes.
