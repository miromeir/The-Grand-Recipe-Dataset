<instructions>
With an electric mixer, beat butter on medium for 1 minute.
Add salted caramel sauce and vanilla extract, and beat on medium for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed.
Add powdered sugar and salt, and beat on low until powdered sugar is incorporated.
Increase speed to medium, and beat until smooth and well-combined, about 2-3 additional minutes.
This will make enough for a 2-layer 9-inch cake or about 24 cupcakes.
