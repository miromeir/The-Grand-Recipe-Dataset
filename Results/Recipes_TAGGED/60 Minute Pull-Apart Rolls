<instructions>
Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans; set aside.
In a small saucepan, stir milk, sugar, and 3 tablespoons butter together. Heat over low heat just until butter melts and sugar dissolves. Cool to about 100-105 F.
Pour the milk mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the yeast and warm water, and stir to combine.
Add 2 cups flour and salt to yeast mixture. Using a dough hook, mix on low speed for about 1 minute.
With the mixer still going, add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Mix about 1 &#189; minutes, or until dough starts to clean the sides of the bowl.
Knead on low speed for about 2 more minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic &#8211; the dough will still be slightly sticky to the touch.
Place dough in a greased bowl, turning it to grease the top. Cover the dough with a clean, dry dish towel.
Let it rise in a warm place, free from draft, for about 15 minutes.
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 16 equal pieces.
Place 8 pieces of dough in each pan.
Cover the pans with the dish towel, and let the dough rise for about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Melt remaining butter. Set aside
Bake for 18-25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown.
Brush rolls with melted butter.
Remove from pans, and cool on wire racks.
