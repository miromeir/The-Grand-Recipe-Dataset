In a small bowl, blend Dijon mustard and honey. Mix in the tarragon, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the skillet, and brush on both sides with the Dijon mustard mixture. Pour 1/4 cup wine around the chicken. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer about 10 minutes, until liquid is reduced.

Pour another 1/4 cup wine around the chicken, and continue to cook about 5 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from heat, reserving remaining liquid.

Mix remaining wine into the skillet. Increase heat to medium, and scrape up browned bits. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced by about 1/3. Serve as a sauce over the chicken.
