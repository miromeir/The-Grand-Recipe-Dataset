<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a cookie sheet (I use a 15x11-inch rimmed cookie sheet) with edges.
Melt butter in a large saucepan.
Once butter has melted, stir in Dr Pepper and cocoa powder; bring to a boil.
Once at a boil, add milk; stir to combine.
Remove pan from heat.
Add the yogurt, eggs, coconut flavor, and vanilla, and stir until well-combined.
Stir in sugar, flour, baking soda, and salt until just combined.
Bake for 15-20 minutes.
While the cake is baking, prepare the icing.
For the icing, combine the butter, buttermilk, Dr Pepper, and cocoa powder in a saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Remove from heat, and add the powdered sugar, and coconut flavor. Stir to combine.
Pour icing over hot cake, and spread evenly over cake.
Once the cake as cooled to room temperature, sprinkle evenly with toasted coconut just before serving.
