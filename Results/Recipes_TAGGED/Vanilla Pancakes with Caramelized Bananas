<instructions>
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Make a well in the dry ingredients, and add the wet into the dry; mix until just combined.
Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Grease skilled with butter or nonstick cooking spray.
Add 1/4 cup batter per pancake.
Cook until bubbles form and the edges start to look dry, about 2 minutes.
Flip pancake over, and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the other side is lightly browned.
Meanwhile, make the caramelized bananas.
Melt the butter in a separate skillet over medium-low heat.
Add the butter and let it melt.
Once the most of the butter has melted, stir in the sugar; continue stirring until the sugar melts.
Add the banana slices, and cook until the bananas begin to soften and caramelize.
Flip bananas over and continue cooking until the other side has caramelized, about 2-3 minutes.
Add the pecans, if using, and stir to combine.
Pour the banana sauce over hot pancakes.
