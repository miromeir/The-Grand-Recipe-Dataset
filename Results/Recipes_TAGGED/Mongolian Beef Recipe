<instructions>
In a medium bowl, whisk soy sauce and cornstarch together.
Add sliced beef to soy sauce mixture, and toss to coat.
Set aside to rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk hoisin sauce, sherry, and sugar together in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.
Chop green onions into 1-inch pieces. Set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add garlic, ginger, and beef with its sauce. Quickly toss to combine.
Let the beef cook for 30 seconds without stirring. 
Stir in green onions, and cook, stirring regularly, until they're just starting to wilt. 
Pour the hoisin sauce mixture in along with the sesame oil, and cook until just thickened.
I serve this over rice topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
