<instructions>
Line slow cooker with a foil collar against the back half of the cooker, and spray slow cooker insert with nonstick cooking spray.
Microwave potatoes and 2 tablespoons milk in a covered bowl, stirring twice, for 6-8 minutes, or until almost tender. Uncover, and set aside to cool slightly.
White the potatoes are in the microwave, melt butter in a large saucepan.
Add garlic and thyme; cook for 30 seconds.
Stir in remaining milk, broth, cornstarch, and pepper.
Bring milk mixture to simmer, whisking constantly, until just thickened.
Whisk in cheese, and stir until cheese has melted. Remove from heat. The sauce should be nice and pourable. If it's too thick, stir in additional chicken broth. 
Pour about 1/3 cheese mixture over the bottom of the slow cooker. 
Layer the potatoes in, overlapping as you go.
Top potatoes with diced ham.
Pour cheese sauce over the top, spreading as necessary.
Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, about 4-6 hours on low. 
Remove foil collar, and let potatoes cool for 20 minutes before serving.
