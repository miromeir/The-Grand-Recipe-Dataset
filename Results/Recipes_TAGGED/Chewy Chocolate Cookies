<instructions>
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In a separate small bowl, whisk corn syrup, egg white, and vanilla together until well-combined. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat butter and sugars together on medium until well-combined, about 2 minutes.
Add corn syrup mixture, and beat on low until well-combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides as needed.
Stir in flour until just incorporated. Cookie dough should look like thick brownie batter at this point.
Cover, and chill dough until firm, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Scoop 1.5 tablespoon scoops of dough, and place on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8-11 minutes. Cookies will look set on the top and at the edges but will look underdone in the cracks.
Immediately remove from baking sheet and place on a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
