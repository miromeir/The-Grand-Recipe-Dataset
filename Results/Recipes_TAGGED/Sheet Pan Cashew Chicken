<instructions>
In a medium saucepan, whisk together sauce ingredients until combined.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring regularly, until sauce thickens.
Remove from heat, and set aside.
Preheat oven to 400F. Line a large rimmed sheet pan* with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.
Place chicken on prepared sheet pan, and drizzle 1/3 sauce over chicken.
Toss chicken to coat in sauce.
Cook for 8 minutes.
Remove pan from oven, and place broccoli, bell peppers, and cashews in a single layer around the chicken.
Pour remaining sauce over chicken and veggies; toss to coat.
Return pan to the oven, and continue cooking for an additional 8-12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
Serve by itself or over white rice, brown rice, or quinoa.
Sprinkle with extra cashews, if desired.
