<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 325F and set a rack in the lower middle position.
Pat the beef dry and season with 1 teaspoon of the salt and pepper. 
In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat.
Brown the meat in batches and then remove to a plate.**
Add the remaining tablespoon oil to the now-empty pot. 
Add the onions and garlic, and sautee for 3-4 minutes, stirring regularly. 
Stir in the balsamic vinegar and tomato paste; cook, stirring regularly, for about 1-2 minutes. 
Add the flour, rosemary, and thyme, and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring regularly.
Return the beef and its juices back to the pot.
Add the beef broth, water, and bay leaves, and stir to combine. 
Bring to a boil.
Cover, and bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours.
Carefully remove the pot from the oven, and add the carrots and potatoes. 
Cover, and return to the oven for 1 hour more, or until the vegetables are cooked, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender. 
Sprinkle with parsley, if desired, before serving.
