<instructions>
Preheat oven to 300 F. Line a 9x9-inch pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease the parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla until well-combined.
Stir in flour until just incorporated.
Press crust evenly into prepared pan.
Prick the crust with a fork all over the base.
Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and middle is light golden brown.
While the crust is hot, drop spoonfuls of marshmallow fluff on top, and gently spread to smooth it out.
Let crust cool to room temperature in pan.
When crust is cool, unwrap caramels.
Place caramels and cream in microwave-safe bowl.
Heat 30 seconds, and stir. Continue heating and stirring until smooth and melted.
Stir in peanuts.
Pour caramel/peanut mixture over marshmallow.
Chill, uncovered, until set (about an hour).
Once caramel is set, heat chocolate in microwave-safe bowl for 30 seconds. Stir until melted.
Pour melted chocolate over caramel, spreading as necessary.
Chill, uncovered, at least 3 hours before cutting and serving.
