<instructions>
Grease a 9x13-inch metal baking pan; set aside.
In a small saucepan, stir milk, sugar, and butter together. Heat over low heat just until butter melts and sugar dissolves. Cool to about 100-105 F.
Pour the milk mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the yeast and warm water.
Add 2 cups flour and salt to yeast mixture. Using a dough hook, mix on low speed for about 1 minute.
With the mixer still going, add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Mix about 1 &#189; minutes, or until dough starts to clean the sides of the bowl.
Knead on low speed for about 2 more minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic &#8211; the dough will still be slightly sticky to the touch.
Place dough in a greased bowl, turning it to grease the top. Cover the dough with a clean, dry dish towel.
Let it rise in a warm place, free from draft, for about 10 minutes.
While dough is rising, prepare the topping.
Whisk melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, corn syrup, and salt together in medium bowl until smooth.
Add water and whisk until combined.
Pour mixture into prepared pan. If necessary, tilt pan to get mixture to cover pan. Sprinkle evenly with pecans, if using. Set aside.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll into a 12x16-inch rectangle.
Stir filling ingredients together, and spread over dough. Since the filling is a little crumbly, I gently press it into the dough to help it stick.
Roll dough up lengthwise, pinching seam to seal.
Cut into 12 pieces, and place over topping in prepared baking dish. I use a serrated knife to cut the dough.
Cover the baking dish with the dish towel, and let the dough rise for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 F.
Bake at 20-25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown.
Tent with aluminum foil, and continue to bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until baked through.
Let the sticky buns cool in pan for 5 minutes.
Place a serving dish over the pan, and carefully invert pan. Be careful as topping will be hot.
Remove pan, and replace any topping that has fallen off.
Let buns sit 10-15 minutes before serving.
