<instructions>
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine water, honey, and yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes, or until it's foamy.
Add the oil, and stir in.
Stir in flour and salt until incorporated. Dough should be a little sticky but not wet. If the dough is too sticky, add additional flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together.
Replace the paddle attachment with a dough hook, and knead dough for 5 minutes.
Place dough in a large, greased bowl. Turn to coat dough.
Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until double in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 F.
Divide dough into 16 equal pieces.
Roll (like you&#8217;re making a clay snake) each piece into a dough rope that is about 9-10 inches long and about 1/2-inch thick.
Shape into a knot (fold one end of dough over the other so that it looks like an awareness ribbon. Twist dough at the place where the two sides overlap. Fold ends back, and tuck under). You can also just tie the dough into a knot and leave the ends out.
Place knots on a rimmed cookie sheet (or sheet pan) lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until light golden brown.
To make the garlic butter, melt butter in a small saucepan.
When the butter has melted, stir in the garlic, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder.
Brush garlic butter over baked rolls, and sprinkle with cheese, if using.
Enjoy warm or at room temperature.
