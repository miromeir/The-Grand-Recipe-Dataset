<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9x9-inch cake pan. Set aside.
To make the cake, pour boiling water over oatmeal. Let it stand for 20 minutes.
With an electric mixer (either hand or stand), beat together butter and sugars. Mix until well-combined.
Add vanilla and eggs. Mix well.
Add oatmeal mixture, and stir to combine.
Stir together whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
Add to batter in one addition and stir until just combined.
Pour into prepared pan.
Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Remove cake and turn oven to broil.
Toward the end of the baking time, make the topping.
In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar, cream or canned milk, nuts, and coconut.
Spread the topping on the hot cake. Return to oven and broil until bubbly, about 3-4 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool. Serve warm.
