<instructions>
Sprinkle both sides of chicken with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
In large skillet over medium high heat, melt butter with olive oil.
Add onion and saute for about 2 minutes.
Stir in garlic, and saute for about 1 minute.
Move onions and garlic to side of pan, and add seasoned chicken.
Saute for about 3 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned.
Transfer chicken, garlic, and onions to the crock pot.
Pour chicken broth and 2 tablespoons lemon juice around chicken.
Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or high for 3-4 hours.
Remove chicken and keep warm.
Stir together cream, mustard, remaining tablespoon lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Whisk in juice in crock pot. Do not cover.
Continue to stir until thickened. Sauce will thicken a little more as it continues to cook.
Whisk in additional corn starch as needed to get sauce to desired consistency.
Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
Serve creamy lemon sauce over chicken.
