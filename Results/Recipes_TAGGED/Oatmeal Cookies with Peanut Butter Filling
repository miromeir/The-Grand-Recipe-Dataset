<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats; set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter and sugars together until light and creamy.
Beat in the egg until well-combined.
Stir in the vanilla extract until combined.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, stirring on low speed until just incorporated.
Drop cookies by tablespoonful onto prepared baking sheets, spacing dough about 2-inches apart.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until they&#8217;re golden brown.
Allow cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes.
Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.
To prepare the filling, beat together butter, peanut butter, and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
Stir in vanilla extract.
Add milk, and beat to combine. Filling should be at a spreadable consistency.
Once cookies are cool, turn half cookies flat side up.
Spread those cookies with peanut butter filling.
Top filling with another cookie.
