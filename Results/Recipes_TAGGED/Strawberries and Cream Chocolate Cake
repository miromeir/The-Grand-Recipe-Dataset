<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together the sugar, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla.
Whisk the flour mixture into the sugar mixture along with the buttermilk and warm water.
Pour the batter to the prepared pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, about 40 minutes.
Transfer to a rack to cool for 20 minutes, then loosen cake and flip out onto the rack to cool completely.
To put it all together, beat heavy cream to soft peak stage.
Add sugar and vanilla extract, and continue beating to form stiff peaks.
Slice cake in half horizontally.
Top bottom half of cake with 1/3 whipped cream. 
Lay a single layer of strawberries over whipped cream.
Replace top layer of cake, and top with remaining whipped cream and strawberries.
Cover, and chill any leftovers.
