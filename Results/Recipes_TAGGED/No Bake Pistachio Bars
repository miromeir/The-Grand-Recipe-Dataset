Line a 9-inch baking pan with foil, allowing for an overhang at the edges. Lightly grease the foil
For the crust, cook egg, butter, cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla together in a saucepan over medium-low heat just until it starts to bubble.
Remove from heat, and stir in graham cracker crumbs.
Stir in pistachios until combined.
Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking pan.
To make the filling, beat butter, pudding mix, and milk together until well-combined.
Add the powdered sugar, and beat in until combined.
Spread pudding mixture over crust.
Cover, and chill for about 1 hour, or until firm.
To make the topping, melt chocolate and butter together over low heat, stirring frequently.
Once mixture had melted and is combined, spread over pudding.
