TO MAKE THE CAKE
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until combined. 
Beat in eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla until well-combined.
Add mashed potatoes and melted chocolate. Mix until incorporated. 
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated. 
Pour batter into prepared baking pan, smoothing as needed.
Bake for 35-50 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
Let cake cool to room temperature before frosting.
