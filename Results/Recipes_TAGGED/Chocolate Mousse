<instructions>
Add chocolates, mini marshmallows, and milk to a large, heavy saucepan.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until melted and well-combined.
Remove from heat, and cool completely. This is key. If the chocolate mixture is still warm, it will melt the whipped cream.
In a large bowl, beat whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla together to soft peak stage.
Reserve 3/4 whipped cream to top mousse for serving.
Cover, and chill reserved whipped cream until ready to serve.
Fold 2 cups whipped cream into cooled chocolate mixture until well-combined.
Add chocolate/whipped cream mixture to remaining whipped cream, and fold to combine.
Divide mousse among dishes, and chill for at least 30 minutes, or until ready to serve.
Serve topped with reserved whipped cream.
Refrigerate any leftovers.
