<instructions>
Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, garlic, vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, pepper, sesame oil, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a boil.

Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir into the sauce. Remove from heat and set aside to cool and thicken.

Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).

Season chicken wings with lemon-pepper seasoning.

Fry chicken wings in batches of 6 to 8 at a time in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the wing, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Put cooked wings into a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over the wings and toss to coat.
