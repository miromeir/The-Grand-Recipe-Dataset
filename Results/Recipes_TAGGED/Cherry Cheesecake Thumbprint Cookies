<instructions>
Line two cookie sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
In a large bowl, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and sugar until fluffy and well-combined.
Beat in egg, scraping down the sides as needed.
Stir in vanilla extract until incorporated.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in flour mixture until just incorporated.
Cover, and refrigerate dough at least 3 hours (up to 24 hours). The cookies will hold their shape better if you refrigerate the dough for 8-24 hours.
Toward the end of the chilling time, preheat oven to 350 F.
Scoops dough using a medium cookie scoop (1 &#189; tablespoons).
Roll in graham cracker crumbs, and place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 8-12 minutes. You want the edges to be just barely golden brown.
Remove from oven, and immediately press 1/2 tablespoon measuring spoon into each cookie to create an indentation.
Fill indentation with fruit filling.
Let cool for 5-10 minutes on the cookie sheet.
Transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.
Store leftover cookies in the fridge.
