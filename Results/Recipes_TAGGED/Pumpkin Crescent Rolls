<instructions>
In a large bowl, stir together yeast, water, and honey. Let sit 5-10 minutes, or until foamy. 
Stir in pumpkin puree, dry milk, butter, brown sugar, and eggs until combined. 
Add 2 cups all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. Stir to combine. 
Continue adding in enough all-purpose flour to make a soft dough.
Knead dough for about 3-5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
Place in a lightly greased bowl, and cover.
Let rise until double, about 1-1 1/2 hours. 
Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, and divide into three pieces. 
Cover, and let rest 10 minutes. 
Meanwhile, beat cinnamon honey butter ingredients together. Set aside. 
Roll each piece of dough into 12-inch circle. 
Spread with 1/3 of cinnamon honey butter, and cut into 12 pieces.*
Repeat with remaining two pieces of dough and remaining cinnamon honey butter. 
Place shaped rolls on greased baking sheets, point side down, about 2-3 inches apart.
Cover, and let rise about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Bake rolls for about 12-15 minutes, or until light golden brown. 
Brush warm rolls with additional melted butter.
