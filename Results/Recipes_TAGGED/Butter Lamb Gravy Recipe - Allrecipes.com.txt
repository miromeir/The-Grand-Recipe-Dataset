Season the lamb with garam masala and salt. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the lamb cubes until browned, stirring constantly. Remove from the skillet and set aside.

Melt the remaining butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the turmeric, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the cayenne and tomato paste until well blended, then stir in the water. Bring to a simmer and return lamb to the skillet. Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes, or until lamb is tender.

Stir in the cream and honey. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with cilantro.
