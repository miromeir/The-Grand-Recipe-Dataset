<instructions>
Preheat oven to 400 Line a 9x13-inch rimmed cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking liner. Set aside.
In a small saucepan, melt butter.
When butter is mostly melted, stir in milk, and heat mixture to 100-110 F.
Meanwhile, add yeast and honey to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl if mixing by hand).
When milk mixture is at temperature, add to yeast and honey; stir to combine.
Add salt and egg, and stir until combined.
Stir in 2 &#189; cups of flour.
Add remaining flour until dough clings to paddle and cleans the sides of the bowl.
Switch to the dough hook, and knead for 2 minutes (or by hand for about 5 minutes).
With lightly floured hands, shape dough into 12 knots, and place dough on prepared baking sheet.
Cover, and let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Bake for about 9-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
While the knots are baking, prepare the garlic butter.
In a small bowl, stir together ingredients for garlic butter.
After removing the rolls from the oven, brush with garlic butter, sprinkle with cheese if using, and enjoy!
If you would prefer to use active dry yeast, substitute an equal amount for the instant yeast. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy. Then, continue with the recipe as written.
