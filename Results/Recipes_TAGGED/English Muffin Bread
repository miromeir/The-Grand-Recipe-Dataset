<instructions>
Grease 2 8x4-inch bread pans; set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, stir together the yeast, milk, and sugar.
Let the yeast mixture sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it&#8217;s foamy.
Add flour, baking soda, and salt to the yeast mixture, and stir on low for 1 minute. Dough will be wet and very sticky.
Cover bowl with greased plastic wrap, and let it sit for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Divide dough evenly between the two prepared pans.
Cover each pan with heavily greased plastic wrap.
Let the dough rise for about 20 minutes, or until the dough reaches the edge of the pan.
Toward the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 375 F.
Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
Turn the bread out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
