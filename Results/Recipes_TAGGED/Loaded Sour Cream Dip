<instructions>
Mix sour cream and cream cheese together until well-combined.
Fold in cheese, bacon, ranch seasoning mix, and chives. 
Taste, and season with salt and pepper as needed. 
Cover, and chill for at least an hour. The longer you let it sit, the more the flavors will meld.
Take out the dip 15-20 minutes before serving to let it soften. 
Serve with thick/sturdy potato chips.
