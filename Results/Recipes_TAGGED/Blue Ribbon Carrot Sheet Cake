TO MAKE THE CARROT CAKE
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan. I use a nonstick baking spray with flour in it. 
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together buttermilk, oil, and sugar until well-combined.
Mix in eggs, one at a time, until combined. 
Stir in vanilla. 
Add pineapple and carrots; stir until just incorporated.
Stir in flour mixture until just combined.
Add coconut and nuts, if using. Stir until just combined. Batter will be wet. 
Pour batter into prepared baking pan, smoothing as necessary.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
