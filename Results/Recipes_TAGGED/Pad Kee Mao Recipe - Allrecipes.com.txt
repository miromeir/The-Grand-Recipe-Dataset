<instructions>
Place the dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and let soak until white and softened, about 1 hour. Drain the noodles, and set aside.

Heat 1 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in a wok or large skillet over low heat, and cook and stir 2 minced garlic cloves until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the soaked noodles, 1/2 teaspoon of thick soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons of sugar, and cook and stir until the noodles have absorbed the soy sauce and turned brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the noodles from the skillet.

Heat the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil in the wok over low heat; stir in the remaining 2 minced garlic cloves, and cook until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high, and stir in the pork, serrano pepper, basil, 1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt. Cook and stir until the pork is no longer pink and the edges of the meat are beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Return the noodles to the wok, and stir in the bean sprouts. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 more minutes.
