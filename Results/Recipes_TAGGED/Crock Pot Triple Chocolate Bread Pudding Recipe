<instructions>
Lightly grease a medium (4-5 quart) crock pot. 
Add bread to crock pot.
Top with chocolate chips.
In a large bowl, whisk together sugars, cocoa powder, eggs, milk, half-and-half, and vanilla. It's ok if it's a little lumpy, but you don't want big piecies of cocoa powder. 
Pour milk mixture over bread, gently pressing bread down as needed.
Place a thin cotton towel over the top of the slow cooker.
Cover, and cook on low for about 3-3 1/2 hours.
