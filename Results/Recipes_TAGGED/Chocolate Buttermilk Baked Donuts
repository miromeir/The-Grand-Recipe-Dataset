Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 2 standard sized donut pans (12 donuts total); set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Add egg, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined. Batter will be on the thicker side.
Spoon batter into a donut pan, filling about 3/4 full.
Bake for about 8-10 minutes. Donuts should spring back when lightly touched.
Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes.
Remove from pan, and set on wire cooling rack.
When donuts are almost room temperature, whisk together powdered sugar, cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons buttermilk, and vanilla extra until well-combined.
Add additional buttermilk as needed to make a thick glaze.
Dip cooled donuts into glaze, and let set before eating.
