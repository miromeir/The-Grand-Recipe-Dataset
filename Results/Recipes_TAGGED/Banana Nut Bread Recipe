<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk mashed banana and melted butter together until well-combined.
Whisk in sugars until incorporated.
Add egg and vanilla, and whisk until well-combined.
Stir in flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon until combined.
Add nuts, and whisk until just incorporated.
Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan, and sprinkle with additional nuts.
Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. I check the bread around 35-40 minutes and tent with foil if it is browning too quickly.
Let cool in pan for a 5-10 minutes.
Remove bread to wire cooling rack, and let cool completely before slicing.
