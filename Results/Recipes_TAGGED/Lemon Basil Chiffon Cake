Preheat oven to 325 F.
In a medium bowl, whisk together, flour, 1 1/4 cups sugar, baking power, and salt. Set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, and oil.
Whisk in basil, lemon zest and vanilla extract.
Add the flour mixture to the egg yolk mixture, and whisk until just combined.
In a separate large bowl, beat egg whites on high until foamy.
Add cream of tartar, and beat until soft peaks form.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and continue beating until still peaks form.
Gently stir one-fourth of egg white mixture into batter; gently fold in remaining egg white mixture.
Spoon batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, spreading evenly.
Break air pockets by cutting through batter with a knife.
Bake for about 45 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.
Invert pan; cool completely.
Loosen cake from sides of pan using a narrow metal spatula or knife.
Invert cake onto plate.
Serve with strawberries, if desired.
