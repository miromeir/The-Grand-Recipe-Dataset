<instructions>
Heat large skillet over medium heat.
Add olive oil.
Sprinkle roast with salt, pepper, and thyme.
Brown roast on every side, beginning fat side down.
Place browned roast and any drippings in crock pot insert fat side up. I use either a 5 or 6 quart slow cooker for this recipe.
Add beef broth and smashed garlic to the insert.
Cover, and cook on LOW for 8-9 hours.
Remove roast from insert. The roast should easily shred with two forks.
Tent roast beef with aluminum foil to keep warm.
Carefully pour all but 1 cup of the cooking liquid into a saucepan.
Stir remaining 1 cup liquid and cornstarch together until combined.
Stir cornstarch mixture into cooking liquid.
Bring cooking liquid to boil over medium heat.
Once at a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to cook, stirring regularly, until slightly thickened.
Serve gravy over shredded meat.
