<instructions>
For the burgers, divide meat into 8 equal pieces.
Shape each piece into a patty. Set aside.
In a small bowl, stir together spice blend ingredients.
Add cream cheese to spice blend, and stir until combined.
Place 1 ounce of cream cheese mix in the center of one of the patties.
Place another patty on top of cream cheese mixture, and carefully seal patties together, reshaping as needed. Gently flatten patties out a little if necessary.
Repeat with remaining cream cheese and patties.
Season patties with additional salt and pepper to taste.
Grill to your desired level of doneness.
Toward the end of the cooking time, top each burger with a slice of cheese and allow it to melt.
To assemble, place lettuce on bottom burger bun.
Top with cheeseburger, ranch, pico de gallo, and then tortilla stips.
Enjoy!
