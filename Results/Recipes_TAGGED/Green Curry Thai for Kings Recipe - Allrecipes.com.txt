<instructions>
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the shallots, garlic, and ginger in the hot oil 3 to 4 minutes, until shallots are tender. Mix in the green curry paste. Cook and stir 1 minute. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and place the chicken and lemon grass in the skillet. Cook 5 minutes, until chicken begins to brown. Mix in the baby corn and water chestnuts. Cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.

Mix the coconut milk into the skillet, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the coconut milk has thickened. Top with basil leaves to serve.
