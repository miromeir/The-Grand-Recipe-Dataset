In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl), stir together the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let stand for 5-10 minutes or until foamy.
Mix in flour and salt until dough clears the sides of the bowl.
Knead dough for three minutes.
Cover, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
Grease an 11X17-inch baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
Roll out the dough into about a 12x16-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick on a floured surface.
Cut into 8 long strips with a pizza cutter.
Cut the strips in half horizontally to make 16 strips.
Twist strips or leave in strips.
Place twist on prepared baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining strips.
Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise 20 minutes.
Toward the end of the rising time, preheat oven to 350 F.
Uncover, and bake 12-20 minutes or until golden brown.
While breadsticks are baking, stir together granulated sugar and ground cinnamon.
Brush bread sticks with half melted butter.
Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture.
Drizzle remaining half butter over breadsticks.
