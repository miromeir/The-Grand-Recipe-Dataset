<instructions>
In a medium bowl, whisk together first 10 ingredients (up to roast).
Place cubed roast into Instant Pot.
Pour sauce over cubed meat.
Close the lid, and make sure the pressure release valve is turned to "SEALING".
Press the MEAT program button, and adjust time to 40 minutes. The pot should reach pressure within 10-15 minutes.
Once the pot reaches pressure, it will begin counting down.
Once it has finished cooking, it will beep and switch to keep warm.
Allow beef to remain in pot for 25 minutes NPR (natural pressure release).
Carefully release any pressure left at that time by turning the pressure release valve to "VENTING".
