<instructions>
In a chilled bowl, beat cream on high until stiff peaks begin to form.
Cover and chill while you continue.
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla together until well-combined, about 2-3 minutes on high. It's important that the cream cheese and sugar be well-combined, so don't cut this step short. 
Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until combined. 
Chill leftovers.
