<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats. Set aside. 
In a medium bowl, whisk whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. Check out the notes on measuring flour for tips. 
Add butter and the sugars to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. 
With the mixer on low speed, mix just until the butter and sugars are blended, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of the bowl.
Add the eggs one at a time, and mix until just combined.
Stir in vanilla just until incorporated. 
Add the flour mixture, and stir in just until combined. Do not overmix.
Add the chocolate, and stir in until just incorporated. 
Scoop 1.5 tablespoon scoops of dough onto the baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between them.
Bake the cookies for 10-15 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown at the edges and just set in the centers. The cookies should be slightly underbaked to stay soft and chewy. If you prefer a crispier cookie, bake an additional 1-2 minutes. 
Transfer the cookies still on the baking mat or parchment paper onto the counter to cool.
