<instructions>
Cover the ribs with cold water, refrigerate, and soak for 1 hour. Drain the ribs, place in a saucepan with 4 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Cook the ribs for 10 minutes, drain, and reserve 2 cups of liquid. Place the ribs and the reserved liquid in a large pot.

Mix together the soy sauce, garlic, onion, rice wine, and brown sugar in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the ribs and broth. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

Mix in the carrots, potatoes, shiitake mushrooms, corn syrup, sesame oil, chestnuts, and dates, and simmer until the meat and vegetables are very tender, about 1 more hour.

Remove the beef and vegetables to a serving dish, and reduce the liquid in the pot to make a thickened gravy. Pour the sauce over the ribs and vegetables, sprinkle with sliced green onion, and serve.
