<instructions>
Place a 6-cup container in the freezer. I've used an 8x4 and a 9x5-inch loaf pan, and either one will work.
Beat heavy whipping cream on high until stiff peaks form.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk and cocoa powder until well-combined.
Fold 1 cup whipped cream into milk mixture.
Fold in remaining whipped cream.
Remove container from freezer, and pour half of the ice cream mixture into container.
Sprinkle half of the chopped cherries and brownie pieces over the ice cream.
Finely chop or grate half of the chocolate over the top of the brownies and chocolate. Pour rest of ice cream over the top.
Top with remaining half cherries, brownies, and rest of chocolate.
Cover tightly, and freeze for 6-8 hours, or until firm.
