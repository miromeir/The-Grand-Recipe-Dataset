<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir oats, flour, baking soda, salt, apple pie spice, and cinnamon together. Set aside.
In a separate large bowl, whisk butter, applesauce, and sugars together until combined. 
Whisk in the egg and vanilla until well-combined. 
Stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. 
Fold in the apples and nuts. The cookie dough will feel thick and maybe even a little dry. 
Using a medium cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoon), scoop cookie dough, and place 2 inches apart on the cookie sheet. 
Sprinkle with sparkling sugar, if using.
Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until set and lightly browned at the edges.
Let cool 5-10 minutes on baking sheet, and then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
