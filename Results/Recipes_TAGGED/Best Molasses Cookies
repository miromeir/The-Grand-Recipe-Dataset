<instructions>
Preheat oven to 325F.
In large bowl, beat brown sugar, shortening, butter, molasses, and egg until well-combined.
Stir in remaining ingredients except granulated sugar.
Shape dough by rounded tablespoonfuls into 1 1/2-inch balls. Dip tops into granulated sugar.
On ungreased cookie sheet, place balls, sugared sides up, about 2 inches apart.
Bake 10-15 minutes or just until set. The cookies will still look a little wet in the cracks, but the tops and edges should be set. The cookies will also be a little puffed up but will deflate as they cool.
Let cookies cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes, and then remove cookies to cooling rack.
