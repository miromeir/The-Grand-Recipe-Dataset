Beat the butter until smooth and creamy.
Mix in the peanut butter and vanilla until well-combined, about 2 minutes.
Add in sugars and beat until well-combined, scraping down the sides as needed, about 2 minutes.
Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Add candies and chocolate chips, and stir to combine.
Cover and chill for 30 minutes.***
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 F. Line two large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Scoop 1.5 tablespoons (medium cookie scoop) of dough onto the prepared cookie sheet, spacing cookies 2 inches apart. 
Bake for 9-13 minutes, or until the edges are golden and the centers are set. 
Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
