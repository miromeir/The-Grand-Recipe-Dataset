Place scoops of ice cream on a tray or in a muffin tin.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and freeze until solid, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Toss corn flakes, sugar, and cinnamon together on a small rimmed baking sheet.
Drizzle with butter, and toss to combine.
Bake corn flake mixture until toasted, about 4-5 minutes.
Let corn flake mixture cool completely.
Roll each scoop of ice cream in corn flake mixture until well-coated.
Re-freeze scoops for at least 2 hours, or until frozen solid.
Can serve topped with a drizzle of honey, chocolate sauce, or whipped cream.
