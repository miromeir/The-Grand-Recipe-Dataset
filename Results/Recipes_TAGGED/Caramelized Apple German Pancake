<instructions>
Heat the oven to 350 F.
In a small bowl, toss apple slices, 2 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice together; set aside.
Cut the butter into four pieces, and place them in a deep cast iron skillet. I use this 10-inch cast iron skillet or an 8x8-inch baking dish.
Put the skillet or baking dish in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the butter has melted.
Take the pan out of the oven; sprinkle brown sugar over the melted butter.
Add apple slice mixture evenly over brown sugar.
Put the pan back in the oven while you make the remaining batter.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt.
Whisk in milk, and continue whisking until no flour lumps remain.
Add eggs, one at a time, and whisk until incorporated.
Stir in the vanilla extract.
Take the pan out of the oven, and pour the batter over the apples.
Bake for 18-25 minutes, or until the center is set and sides are lightly browned.
The pancake with start to deflate once it is removed from the oven. Serve warm.
