<instructions>
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder.
Heat the butter in the 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat.
Once the butter has completely melted, add the brown sugar. Whisk until the sugar melts.
Add the butter mixture into the flour mixture, and whisk just until it comes together.
Add the egg and vanilla. Whisk until just combined.
Whisk in chocolate, nuts, and coconut until just combined.
Transfer the dough back to the buttery skillet.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on top and set in the middle. Cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes before slicing.
