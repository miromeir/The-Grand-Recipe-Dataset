In a medium bowl, mix together the soy sauce, green onion, sesame seeds, beer and sesame oil. Place meat in the marinade, cover, and refrigerate overnight for best results.

Combine rice and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, until rice is tender.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry beef strips for about 5 minutes on each side, or to your desired doneness.

Serve beef with rice and lettuce leaves. Spoon some rice and beef into a lettuce leaf, fold in the sides and roll up to the top to make a bag of bulgogi. No silverware needed.
