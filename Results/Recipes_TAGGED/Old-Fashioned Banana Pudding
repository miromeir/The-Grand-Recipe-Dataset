<instructions>
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Whisk 1 cup sugar, flour, and salt together in the top of a double boiler.
Stir in 6 egg yolks and milk.
Cook over boiling water for 10-15 minutes, or until thickened, whisking constantly.
Once thickened, remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract.
Spread a little of the pudding mixture in the bottom of a baking dish. I used a 10.5x7.5-inch dish.
Layer about 20 cookies, one third of the banana slices, and one third of the custard.
Repeat layers two more times.
Beat 6 egg whites to soft peak stage.
Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup sugar over egg whites; continue beating to stiff peak stage.
Spoon egg whites over custard, sealing edges.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Serve warm or chilled.
Chill any leftovers.
