<instructions>
Preheat oven to low broil (500-550 F).
Cook ground beef in an oven-safe skillet that's at least 12-inches over medium heat.
Drain and return to pan.
Add the garlic to the pan, and cook for 1 minute.
Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, dried basil, and Italian seasoning.
Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Add 2 cups water and dry pasta.
Bring to boil.
Cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until noodles are tender. If the sauce starts to cook down too much, add additional water as needed.
Stir in the half-and-half and parmesan cheese.
Place slices of mozzarella on top of pasta.
Bake until the cheese has melted, about 2-3 minutes.
