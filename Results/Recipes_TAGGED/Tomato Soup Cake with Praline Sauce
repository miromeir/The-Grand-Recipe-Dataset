Preheat oven to 350&#176;F. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan&#178;.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together.
Add the egg, and beat well.
Stir in soup.
In a small bowl, whisk together flours, baking soda, baking powder, and spices.
Add flour mixture, and stir until just combined.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove from oven, and let cool in pan 5-10 minutes.
Turn cake out onto wire rack to finish cooling.
